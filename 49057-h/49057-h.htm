<h2 id="c1"><br />INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The tales of King Arthur and his Knights are of Celtic origin.
The Celts were the people who occupied Britain at the time
when the history of the country opens, and a few words are
necessary to explain why the characters in the stories act and
speak as though they belonged to a later age.</p>
<p>It is believed that King Arthur lived in the sixth century,
just after the Romans withdrew from Britain, and when the
Britons, left to defend themselves against the attacks of the
marauding Saxons, rose and defeated them at Mount Badon,
securing to themselves peace for many years. It was probably
about this time that King Arthur and his company of Knights
performed the deeds which were to become the themes of
stories and lays for generations afterwards.</p>
<p>In olden times, it was the custom of minstrels and story-tellers
to travel through the land from court to court, telling
of tales of chivalry and heroism, and for many centuries the
tales of King Arthur formed the stock from which the story-teller
drew.</p>
<p>In this way the stories came to be handed down from father to
son, in Brittany (whose people are of the same family as the
Welsh) as well as in Wales and England, and by this means
alone were they prevented from being lost. But in the reigns
of Henry II. and Richard I., they were set down on paper,
and so became literature. Before this, however, a British
writer had written out some of the tales, and from him as well
as from the lips of the bards and story-tellers of their own
generation, the writers in the time of Henry II. were able to
collect their information.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>Now, it will be remembered that the second and third
crusades were being carried on during the reigns of Henry II.
and Richard I., and many English and French Knights were
therefore fighting in the fields of Palestine.</p>
<p>The story-teller, whose living depended on the welcome his
stories met with, instead of telling them according to tradition,
altered them to suit the tastes of his hearers. Thus, the old
heroes of tradition were placed upon prancing horses, clothed
in coats of mail, and armed with lances as if they had been
vassals of King Henry or King Richard. And in this way the
story-teller called up before the minds of the listeners pictures of
deeds of chivalry, such as husbands and brothers were performing
for the Christian faith in far-off Palestine. The writers of
the time, both English and French, set them down as they
heard and knew them, and so in their altered and historically
inaccurate form they have reached us at the present day.</p>
<p>One of the most famous of the books compiled by old
English writers was the &ldquo;Historia Britonum,&rdquo; which was
written (in Latin) by Geoffrey, Bishop of Asaph. It contained
an account of a war which King Arthur waged in
Western Europe, but made no mention of the Holy Grail.</p>
<p>From this and other books of romances compiled in
England, and very largely, too, from books of French
romances, Sir Thomas Malory obtained the material for his
&ldquo;Morte d&rsquo;Arthur,&rdquo; which was written in 1470. This is the
most famous of the early books of Arthurian legend, and it is
from the &ldquo;Morte d&rsquo;Arthur&rdquo; that most of the stories in this
book are taken. Some, however, are taken from the &ldquo;High
History of the Holy Graal,&rdquo; translated from the French by
Dr. Sebastian Evans. The language throughout has been
modified with a view to making the legends more easy of
study.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><br />THE DRAWING OF THE SWORD.</h2>
<p>Long, long ago, after Uther Pendragon died, no king
reigned in Britain, and every Knight hoped to seize the
crown for himself. The country was like to fare ill when
laws were broken on every side, and the corn which was
to give bread to the poor was trodden underfoot, and there
was none to bring the evildoer to justice. Then, when
things were at their worst, came forth Merlin the magician,
and fast he rode to the place where the Archbishop
of Canterbury had his dwelling. They took counsel
together, and agreed that all the lords and gentlemen
of Britain should ride to London and meet on Christmas
Day, now at hand, in the Great Church. So this was
done. And on Christmas morning, as they left the church,
they saw in the churchyard a large stone, and on it a bar
of steel, and in the steel a naked sword was held, and
about it was written in letters of gold, &ldquo;Whoso pulleth
out this sword is by right of birth King of England.&rdquo;
They marvelled at these words, and called for the Archbishop,
and brought him into the place where the stone
stood. Then those Knights who fain would be King took
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
firm hold of the hilt, and they tugged at the sword with
all their might; but it never stirred. The Archbishop
watched them in silence, but when they were faint from
pulling he spoke: &ldquo;The man is not here who shall lift out
that sword, nor do I know where to find him. But this is
my counsel&mdash;that two Knights be chosen, good and true
men, to keep guard over the sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus it was done. But the lords and gentlemen-at-arms
cried out that every man had a right to try to win
the sword, and they decided that on New Year&rsquo;s Day a
tournament should be held, and any Knight who would,
might enter the lists.</p>
<p>So on New Year&rsquo;s Day, the Knights, according to
custom, went to hear service in the Great Church, and
after it was over they met in the field to make ready for
the <a id="er_1" href="#ed_1">tourney</a>. Among them was a brave Knight called
Sir Ector, who brought with him Sir Kay, his son, and
Arthur, Kay&rsquo;s foster-brother. Now Kay had unbuckled
his sword the evening before, and in his haste to be at
the tourney had forgotten to put it on again, and he
begged Arthur to ride back and fetch it for him. But
when Arthur reached the house the door was locked, for
the women had gone out to see the tourney, and, though
Arthur tried his best to get in, he could not. Then he
rode away in great anger, and said to himself, &ldquo;Kay shall
not be without a sword this day. I will take that sword
in the churchyard, and give it to him;&rdquo; and he galloped
fast till he reached the gate of the churchyard. He
jumped down, tied his horse tightly to a tree, and, running
up to the sword, seized the handle, and lightly and fiercely
drew it out; then he mounted his horse again, and
delivered the sword to Sir Kay. The moment Sir Kay
saw the sword he knew it was not his own, but the sword
of the stone, and he sought out his father Sir Ector, and

said to him, &ldquo;Sir, this is the sword of the stone, therefore
I am the rightful King.&rdquo; Sir Ector made no answer, but
signed to Kay and Arthur to follow him, and they all
three went back to the church. Leaving their horses
outside, they entered the choir, and here Sir Ector took a
holy book and bade Sir Kay swear how he came by that
sword. &ldquo;My brother Arthur gave it to me,&rdquo; replied Sir
Kay. &ldquo;How did you come by it?&rdquo; asked Sir Ector,
turning to Arthur. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;when I rode
home for my brother&rsquo;s sword, I found no one to deliver it
to me, and as I resolved he should not be swordless, I
thought of the sword in this stone, and I pulled it out.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Were any Knights present when you did this?&rdquo; asked
Sir Ector. &ldquo;No, none,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;Then you are
the rightful King of this land,&rdquo; said Sir Ector. &ldquo;But
why am I the King?&rdquo; inquired Arthur. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo;
answered Sir Ector, &ldquo;this is an enchanted sword, and no
man could draw it but he who was born a King. Therefore
put the sword back into the stone, and let me see you
take it out.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is soon done,&rdquo; said Arthur, replacing
the sword, and Sir Ector himself tried to draw it, but he
could not. &ldquo;Now it is your turn,&rdquo; he said to Sir Kay,
but Sir Kay fared no better than his father, though he
tugged with all his might and main. &ldquo;Now you, Arthur,&rdquo;
and Arthur pulled it out as easily as if it had been lying
in its sheath, and as he did so Sir Ector and Sir Kay sank
on their knees before him. &ldquo;Why do you, my father and
brother, kneel to me?&rdquo; asked Arthur in surprise. &ldquo;Nay,
nay, my lord,&rdquo; answered Sir Ector, &ldquo;I am not your father,
though till to-day I could not tell you who your father
really was. You are the son of <a id="er_2" href="#ed_2">Uther Pendragon</a>, and you
were brought to me when you were born by <a id="er_3" href="#ed_3">Merlin</a> himself,
who promised that when the time came you should
know from whom you sprang.&rdquo; When Arthur heard that
Sir Ector was not his father, he wept bitterly. &ldquo;If I am
King,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;ask what you will, and I shall not
fail you. For to you, and to my lady and mother, I owe
more than to any one in the world, for she loved me and
treated me as her son.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Sir Ector, &ldquo;I only
ask that you will make your foster-brother, Sir Kay,
<a id="er_4" href="#ed_4">Seneschal</a> of all your lands.&rdquo; &ldquo;That I will readily,&rdquo;
answered Arthur, &ldquo;and while he and I live no other shall
fill that office.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Sir Ector then bade them seek out the Archbishop
with him, and they told him all that had happened concerning
the sword, which Arthur had left standing in the
stone. And on <a id="er_5" href="#ed_5">Twelfth Day</a> the Knights and Barons
came again, but none could draw it out but Arthur.
When they saw this, many of the Barons became angry
and cried out that they would never own a boy for King
whose blood was no better than their own. So it was
agreed to wait till <a id="er_6" href="#ed_6">Candlemas</a>, when more Knights might
be there, and meanwhile the same two men who had been
chosen before watched the sword night and day; but at
Candlemas it was the same thing, and at Easter. And
when Pentecost came, the common people who were present,
and saw Arthur pull out the sword, cried with one
voice that he was their King, and they would kill any
man who said differently.</p>
<p>Then rich and poor fell on their knees before him, and
Arthur took the sword and offered it upon the altar where
the Archbishop stood, and the best man who was there made
him Knight. After that the crown was put on his head,
and he swore to his lords and commons that he would be a
true King, and would do them justice all the days of his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />THE SWORD EXCALIBUR.</h2>
<p>King Arthur, accompanied by Merlin the magician, had
left the comfort of the court to seek adventures. He
had fought a hard battle with the tallest Knight in all
the land, and though he struck hard and well, he would
have been slain had not Merlin enchanted the Knight and
cast him into a deep sleep, and brought the King to a
hermit who had studied the art of healing, and cured all
his wounds in three days. Then Arthur and Merlin
waited no longer, but gave the hermit thanks and
departed.</p>
<p>As they rode together Arthur said, &ldquo;I have no sword,&rdquo;
but Merlin bade him be patient and he would soon give
him one. In a little while they came to a large lake, and
in the midst of the lake Arthur beheld an arm rising out
of the water, holding up a sword. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Merlin,
&ldquo;that is the sword I spoke of.&rdquo; And the King looked
again, and a maiden stood upon the water. &ldquo;That is the
Lady of the Lake,&rdquo; said Merlin, &ldquo;and she is coming to
you, and if you ask her courteously she will give you the
sword.&rdquo; So when the maiden drew near, Arthur saluted
her and said, &ldquo;Maiden, I pray you tell me whose sword is
that which an arm is holding out of the water? I wish
it were mine, for I have lost my sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sword is mine, King Arthur,&rdquo; answered she,
&ldquo;and I will give it to you, if you in return will give me a
gift when I ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;I will give you whatever
gift you ask.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;get into
the <a id="er_7" href="#ed_7">barge</a> yonder, and row yourself to the sword, and take
it and the scabbard with you.&rdquo; For this was the sword
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Excalibur. &ldquo;As for <i>my</i> gift, I will ask it in my own
time.&rdquo; Then King Arthur and Merlin dismounted from
their horses and tied them up safely, and went into the
barge, and when they came to the place where the arm
was holding the sword Arthur took it by the handle, and
the arm disappeared. And they brought the sword back
to land. As they rode the King looked lovingly on his
sword, which Merlin saw, and, smiling, said, &ldquo;Which do
you like best, the sword or the scabbard?&rdquo; &ldquo;I like the
sword,&rdquo; answered Arthur. &ldquo;You are not wise to say
that,&rdquo; replied Merlin, &ldquo;for the scabbard is worth ten of
the sword, and as long as it is buckled on you you will
lose no blood, however sorely you may be wounded.&rdquo; So
they rode into the town of <a id="er_8" href="#ed_8">Carlion</a>, and Arthur&rsquo;s Knights
gave them a glad welcome, and said it was a joy to serve
under a King who risked his life as much as any common
man.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><br />HOW THE ROUND TABLE BEGAN.</h2>
<p>After King Arthur had fought and conquered many
enemies, he said one day to Merlin, whose counsel he
took all the days of his life, &ldquo;My Barons will let me
have no rest, but bid me take a wife, and I have answered
them that I shall take none, except you advise me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; replied Merlin, &ldquo;that you should take a
wife, but is there any woman that you love better than
another?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;I love Guenevere,
daughter of Leodegrance, King of Cameliard, in whose
house is the <a id="er_9" href="#ed_9">Round Table</a> that my father gave him. This
maiden is the fairest that I have ever seen, or ever shall
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
see.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Merlin, &ldquo;what you say as to her
beauty is true, but, if your heart was not set on her, I
could find you another as fair, and of more goodness, than
she. But if a man&rsquo;s heart is once set it is idle to try to
turn him.&rdquo; Then Merlin asked the King to give him a
company of knights and esquires, that he might go to the
Court of King Leodegrance and tell him that King Arthur
desired to wed his daughter, which Arthur did gladly.
Therefore Merlin rode forth and made all the haste he
could till he came to the Castle of Cameliard, and told
King Leodegrance who had sent him and why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the best news I have ever had,&rdquo; replied
Leodegrance, &ldquo;for little did I think that so great and
noble a King should seek to marry my daughter. As for
lands to endow her with, I would give whatever he chose;
but he has lands enough of his own, so I will give him
instead something that will please him much more, the
Round Table which Uther Pendragon gave me, where a
hundred and fifty Knights can sit at one time. I myself
can call to my side a hundred good Knights, but I lack
fifty, for the wars have slain many, and some are absent.&rdquo;
And without more words King Leodegrance gave his consent
that his daughter should wed King Arthur. And
Merlin returned with his Knights and esquires, journeying
partly by water and partly by land, till they drew
near to London.</p>
<p>When King Arthur heard of the coming of Merlin and
of the Knights with the Round Table he was filled with
joy, and said to those that stood about him, &ldquo;This news
that Merlin has brought me is welcome indeed, for I have
long loved this fair lady, and the Round Table is dearer to
me than great riches.&rdquo; Then he ordered that <a id="er_10" href="#ed_10">Sir Lancelot</a>
should ride to fetch the Queen, and that preparations for
the marriage and her coronation should be made, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
was done. &ldquo;Now, Merlin,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;go and look
about my kingdom and bring fifty of the bravest and most
famous Knights that can be found throughout the land.&rdquo;
But no more than eight and twenty Knights could Merlin
find. With these Arthur had to be content, and the
Bishop of Canterbury was fetched, and he blessed the seats
that were placed by the Round Table, and the Knights sat
in them. &ldquo;Fair Sirs,&rdquo; said Merlin, when the Bishop had
ended his blessing, &ldquo;arise all of you, and pay your homage
to the King.&rdquo; So the Knights arose to do his bidding, and
in every seat was the name of the Knight who had sat on
it, written in letters of gold, but two seats were empty.
After that young <a id="er_11" href="#ed_11">Gawaine</a> came to the King, and prayed
him to make him a Knight on the day that he should wed
Guenevere. &ldquo;That I will gladly,&rdquo; replied the King, &ldquo;for
you are my sister&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the King was speaking, a poor man entered the
Court, bringing with him a youth about eighteen years old,
riding on a lean mare, though it was not the custom for
gentlemen to ride on mares. &ldquo;Where is King Arthur?&rdquo;
asked the man. &ldquo;Yonder,&rdquo; answered the Knights. &ldquo;Have
you business with him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man, and he
went and bowed low before the King: &ldquo;I have heard,
O King Arthur, flower of Knights and Kings, that at the
time of your marriage you would give any man the gift
he should ask for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is truth,&rdquo; answered the King, &ldquo;as long as I do
no wrong to other men or to my kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you for your gracious words,&rdquo; said the poor
man; &ldquo;the boon I would ask is that you would make my
son a Knight.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is a great boon to ask,&rdquo; answered the
King. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, my name is Aries the cowherd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it you or your son that has thought of this honour?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is my son who desires it, and not I,&rdquo; replied the
man. &ldquo;I have thirteen sons who tend cattle, and work in
the fields if I bid them; but this boy will do nothing but
shoot and cast darts, or go to watch battles and look on
Knights, and all day long he beseeches me to bring him to
you, that he may be knighted also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; said Arthur, turning to the
young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, my name is Tor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your sword that I may knight you?&rdquo; said
the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is here, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it out of its sheath,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;and require
me to make you a Knight.&rdquo; Then Tor jumped off
his mare and pulled out his sword, and knelt before the
King, praying that he might be made a Knight and a
Knight of the Round Table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for a Knight, that I will make you,&rdquo; said Arthur,
smiting him in the neck with the sword, &ldquo;and if you are
worthy of it you shall be a Knight of the Round Table.&rdquo;
Then was the high feast made ready, and the King was
wedded to fair Guenevere at Camelot in the Church of
St. Stephen with all due observance. And the next day
Gawaine was made a Knight also.</p>
<p>Sir Tor proved before long by his gallant deeds that he
was well worthy to sit in one of the empty seats at the
Round Table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />THE STORY OF SIR BALIN.</h2>
<p>In those days many Kings reigned in the Islands of the
Sea, and they constantly waged war upon each other, and
on their liege lord, and news came to Arthur that Ryons,
King of North Wales, had collected a large host and had
ravaged his lands and slain some of his people. When
he heard this, Arthur rose in anger, and commanded that
all lords, Knights, and gentlemen of arms should meet
him at Camelot, where he would call a council, and hold
a tourney.</p>
<p>From every part the Knights flocked to Camelot, and
the town was full to overflowing of armed men and their
horses. And when they were all assembled, there rode in
a damsel, who said she had come with a message from the
great Lady Lile of <a id="er_12" href="#ed_12">Avelion</a>, and begged that they would
bring her before King Arthur. When she was led into
his presence she let her mantle of fur slip off her shoulders,
and they saw that by her side a richly wrought sword was
buckled. The King was silent with wonder at the strange
sight, but at last he said, &ldquo;Damsel, why do you wear this
sword? for swords are not the ornaments of women.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, my lord,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;I would I could find some
Knight to rid me of this sword, which weighs me down
and causes me much sorrow. But the man who will
deliver me of it must be one who is mighty of his hands,
and pure in his deeds, without villainy, or treason. If I
find a Knight such as this, he will draw this sword out of
its sheath, and he only. For I have been at the Court of
King Ryons, and he and his Knights tried with all their
strength to draw the sword and they could not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see if I can draw it,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;not
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
because I think myself the best Knight, for well I know
how far I am outdone by others, but to set them an
example that they may follow me.&rdquo; With that the King
took the sword by the sheath and by the girdle, and pulled
at it with all his force, but the sword stuck fast. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;
said the damsel, &ldquo;you need not pull half so hard, for he
that shall pull it out shall do it with little strength.&rdquo; &ldquo;It
is not for me,&rdquo; answered Arthur, &ldquo;and now, my Barons,
let each man try his fortune.&rdquo; So most of the Knights
of the Round Table there present pulled, one after another,
at the sword, but none could stir it from its sheath.
&ldquo;Alas! alas!&rdquo; cried the damsel in great grief, &ldquo;I thought
to find in this Court Knights that were blameless and
true of heart, and now I know not where to look for them.&rdquo;
&ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;there are no better Knights
in the world than these of mine, but I am sore displeased
that they cannot help me in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now at that time there was a poor Knight at Arthur&rsquo;s
Court who had been kept prisoner for a year and a half
because he had slain the King&rsquo;s cousin. He was of high
birth and his name was Balin, and after he had suffered
eighteen months the punishment of his misdeed the Barons
prayed the King to set him free, which Arthur did willingly.
When Balin, standing apart beheld the Knights
one by one try the sword, and fail to draw it, his heart
beat fast, yet he shrank from taking his turn, for he was
meanly dressed, and could not compare with the other
Barons. But after the damsel had bid farewell to Arthur
and his Court, and was setting out on her journey homewards,
he called to her and said, &ldquo;Damsel, I pray you to
suffer me to try your sword, as well as these lords, for
though I am so poorly clothed, my heart is as high as
theirs.&rdquo; The damsel stopped and looked at him, and
answered, &ldquo;Sir, it is not needful to put you to such trouble,
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
for where so many have failed it is hardly likely that you
will succeed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah! fair damsel,&rdquo; said Balin, &ldquo;it is not
fine clothes that make good deeds.&rdquo; &ldquo;You speak truly,&rdquo;
replied the damsel, &ldquo;therefore do what you can.&rdquo; Then
Balin took the sword by the girdle and sheath, and pulled
it out easily, and when he looked at the sword he was
greatly pleased with it. The King and the Knights were
dumb with surprise that it was Balin who had triumphed
over them, and many of them envied him and felt anger
towards him. &ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; said the damsel, &ldquo;this is the
best Knight that I ever found, but, Sir, I pray you give
me the sword again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Balin, &ldquo;I will keep it till it is taken
from me by force.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is for your sake, not mine, that I
ask for it,&rdquo; said the damsel, &ldquo;for with that sword you shall
slay the man you love best, and it will bring about your
own ruin.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will take what befalls me,&rdquo; replied Balin,
&ldquo;but the sword I will not give up, by the faith of my
body.&rdquo; So the damsel departed in great sorrow. The
next day Sir Balin left the Court, and, armed with his
sword, set forth in search of adventures, which he found
in many places where he had not thought to meet with
them. In all the fights that he fought, Sir Balin was the
victor, and Arthur, and Merlin his friend, knew that there
was no Knight living of greater deeds, or more worthy of
worship. And he was known to all as Sir Balin le Savage,
the Knight of the two swords.</p>
<p>One day he was riding forth when at the turning of a
road he saw a cross, and on it was written in letters of
gold, &ldquo;Let no Knight ride towards this castle.&rdquo; Sir Balin
was still reading the writing when there came towards
him an old man with white hair, who said, &ldquo;Sir Balin le
Savage, this is not the way for you, so turn again and
choose some other path.&rdquo; And so he vanished, and a
horn blew loudly, as a horn is blown at the death of a
beast. &ldquo;That blast,&rdquo; said Balin, &ldquo;is for me, but I am still
alive,&rdquo; and he rode to the castle, where a great company
of knights and ladies met him and welcomed him, and
made him a feast. Then the lady of the castle said to
him, &ldquo;Knight with the two swords, you must now fight a
Knight that guards an island, for it is our law that no
man may leave us without he first fight a tourney.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<div class="img" id="picb1">
<img src="images/illus_022.jpg" alt="The Damsel Warns Sir Balin." width="416" height="566" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is a bad custom,&rdquo; said Balin, &ldquo;but if I must I
am ready; for though my horse is weary my heart is
strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said a Knight to him, &ldquo;your shield does not look
whole to me; I will lend you another;&rdquo; so Balin listened
to him and took the shield that was offered, and left his
own with his own coat of arms behind him. He rode
down to the shore, and led his horse into a boat which
took them across. When he reached the other side, a
damsel came to him crying, &ldquo;O knight Balin, why have
you left your own shield behind you? Alas! you have
put yourself in great danger, for by your shield you should
have been known. I grieve over your doom, for there is no
man living that can rival you for courage and bold deeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I repent,&rdquo; answered Balin, &ldquo;ever having come into
this country, but for very shame I must go on. Whatever
befalls me, either for life or death, I am ready to take it.&rdquo;
Then he examined his armour, and saw that it was whole,
and mounted his horse.</p>
<p>As he went along the path he beheld a Knight come
out of a castle in front, clothed in red, riding a horse with
red trappings. When this red Knight looked on the two
swords, he thought for a moment it was Balin, but the
shield did not bear Balin&rsquo;s device. So they rode at each
other with their spears, and smote each other&rsquo;s shields so
hard that both horses and men fell to the ground with the
shock, and the Knights lay unconscious on the ground for
some minutes. But soon they rose up again and began
the fight afresh, and they fought till the place was red
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
with their blood, and they had each seven great wounds.
&ldquo;What Knight are you?&rdquo; asked Balin le Savage, pausing
for breath, &ldquo;for never before have I found any Knight to
match me.&rdquo; &ldquo;My name,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is Balan, brother to
the good Knight Balin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cried Balin, &ldquo;that I should ever live to see
this day,&rdquo; and he fell back fainting to the ground. At
this sight Balan crept on his feet and hands, and pulled
off Balin&rsquo;s helmet, so that he might see his face. The
fresh air revived Balin, and he awoke and said: &ldquo;O
Balan, my brother, you have slain me, and I you, and the
whole world will speak ill of us both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; sighed Balan, &ldquo;if I had only known you! I
saw your two swords, but from your shield I thought you
had been another knight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woe is me!&rdquo; said Balin, &ldquo;all this was wrought by
an unhappy knight in the castle, who caused me to change
my shield for his. If I lived, I would destroy that castle
that he should not deceive other men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have done well,&rdquo; answered Balan, &ldquo;for
they have kept me prisoner ever since I slew a Knight
that guarded this island, and they would have kept you
captive too.&rdquo; Then came the lady of the castle and her
companions, and listened as they made their moan. And
Balan prayed that she would grant them the grace to lie
together, there where they died, and their wish was given
them, and she and those that were with her wept for pity.</p>
<p>So they died; and the lady made a tomb for them,
and put Balan&rsquo;s name alone on it, for Balin&rsquo;s name she
knew not. But Merlin knew, and next morning he came
and wrote it in letters of gold, and he ungirded Balin&rsquo;s
sword, and unscrewed the pommel, and put another
pommel on it, and bade a Knight that stood by handle
it, but the Knight could not. At that Merlin laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<div class="img" id="pica2">
<img src="images/illus_025.jpg" alt="The Death of Balin and Balan" width="416" height="666" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you laugh?&rdquo; asked the Knight. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo;
said Merlin, &ldquo;no man shall handle this sword but the
best Knight in the world, and that is either Sir Lancelot
or his son Sir Galahad. With this sword Sir Lancelot
shall slay the man he loves best, and his name is Sir
Gawaine.&rdquo; And this was later done, in a fight across the
seas.</p>
<p>All this Merlin wrote on the pommel of the sword.
Next he made a bridge of steel to the island, six inches
broad, and no man could pass over it that was guilty of
any evil deeds. The scabbard of the sword he left on
this side of the island, so that Galahad should find it.
The sword itself he put in a magic stone, which floated
down the stream to Camelot, that is now called Winchester.
And the same day Galahad came to the river, having in
his hand the scabbard, and he saw the sword and pulled it
out of the stone, as is told in another place.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><br />WHAT BEAUMAINS ASKED OF THE KING.</h2>
<p>As <a id="er_13" href="#ed_13">Pentecost</a> drew near King Arthur commanded that all
the Knights of the Round Table should keep the feast at
a city called Kin-Kenadon, hard by the sands of Wales,
where there was a great castle. Now it was the King&rsquo;s
custom that he would eat no food on the day of Pentecost,
which we call Whit Sunday, until he had heard or seen
some great marvel. So on that morning Sir Gawaine was
looking from the window a little before noon when he
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
espied three men on horseback, and with them a dwarf on
foot, who held their horses when they alighted. Then Sir
Gawaine went to the King and said, &ldquo;Sir, go to your food,
for strange adventures are at hand.&rdquo; And Arthur called
the other Kings that were in the castle, and all the
Knights of the Round Table that were a hundred and
fifty, and they sat down to dine. When they were seated
there entered the hall two men well and richly dressed,
and upon their shoulders leaned the handsomest young
man that ever was seen of any of them, higher than the
other two by a cubit. He was wide in the chest and
large handed, but his great height seemed to be a burden
and a shame to him, therefore it was he leaned on the
shoulders of his friends. As soon as Arthur beheld him
he made a sign, and without more words all three went
up to the high <a id="er_14" href="#ed_14">da&iuml;s</a>, where the King sat. Then the tall
young man stood up straight, and said: &ldquo;King Arthur,
God bless you and all your fair fellowship, and in especial
the fellowship of the Table Round. I have come hither
to pray you to give me three gifts, which you can grant
me honourably, for they will do no hurt to you or to
any one.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ask,&rdquo; answered Arthur, &ldquo;and you shall have
your asking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, this is my petition for this feast, for the other
two I will ask after. Give me meat and drink for this
one twelvemonth.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;you shall
have meat and drink enough, for that I give to every man,
whether friend or foe. But tell me your name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you that,&rdquo; answered he. &ldquo;That is
strange,&rdquo; replied the King, &ldquo;but you are the goodliest
young man I ever saw,&rdquo; and, turning to Sir Kay, the
steward, charged him to give the young man to eat and
drink of the best, and to treat him in all ways as if he
were a lord&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;There is little need to do that,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
answered Sir Kay, &ldquo;for if he had come of gentlemen and
not of peasants he would have asked of you a horse and
armour. But as the birth of a man is so are his requests.
And seeing he has no name I will give him one, and it
shall be Beaumains, or Fair-hands, and he shall sit in the
kitchen and eat broth, and at the end of a year he shall
be as fat as any pig that feeds on acorns.&rdquo; So the young
man was left in charge of Sir Kay, that scorned and
mocked him.</p>
<p>Sir Lancelot and Sir Gawaine were wroth when they
heard what Sir Kay said, and bade him leave off his
mocking, for they believed the youth would turn out
to be a man of great deeds; but Sir Kay paid no heed
to them, and took him down to the great hall, and
set him among the boys and lads, where he ate sadly.
After he had finished eating both Sir Lancelot and Sir
Gawaine bade him come to their room, and would have
had him eat and drink there, but he refused, saying he
was bound to obey Sir Kay, into whose charge the King
had given him. So he was put into the kitchen by Sir
Kay, and slept nightly with the kitchen boys. This he
bore for a whole year, and was always mild and gentle,
and gave hard words to no one. Only, whenever the
Knights played at tourney he would steal out and watch
them. And Sir Lancelot gave him gold to spend, and
clothes to wear, and so did Gawaine. Also, if there were
any games held whereat he might be, none could throw a
bar nor cast a stone as far as he by two good yards.</p>
<p>Thus the year passed by till the feast of Whitsuntide
came again, and this time the king held it at Carlion.
But King Arthur would eat no meat at Whitsuntide till
some adventures were told him, and glad was he when a
squire came and said to him, &ldquo;Sir you may go to your
food, for here is a damsel with some strange tales.&rdquo; At
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
this the damsel was led into the hall, and bowed low
before the King, and begged he would give her help.
&ldquo;For whom?&rdquo; asked the King, &ldquo;and what is the adventure?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;my sister is a noble lady
of great fame, who is besieged by a tyrant, and may not
get out of her castle. And it is because your Knights are
said to be the noblest in all the world that I came to
you for aid.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is your sister&rsquo;s name, and where does
she dwell? And who is the man that besieges her, and
where does he come from?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir King,&rdquo; answered she,
&ldquo;as for my sister&rsquo;s name, I cannot tell it you now, but she
is a lady of great beauty and goodness, and of many lands.
As for the tyrant who besieges her, he is called the Red
Knight of the Red Lawns.&rdquo; &ldquo;I know nothing of him,&rdquo;
said the King. &ldquo;But I know him,&rdquo; cried Sir Gawaine,
&ldquo;and he is one of the most dangerous Knights in the
world. Men say he has the strength of seven, and once
when we had crossed swords I hardly escaped from him
with my life.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fair damsel,&rdquo; then said the King, &ldquo;there
are many Knights here who would go gladly to the rescue
of your lady, but none of them shall do so with my consent
unless you will tell us her name, and the place of her
castle.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then I must speak further,&rdquo; said the damsel.
But before she had made answer to the King up came
Beaumains, and spoke to Arthur, saying, &ldquo;Sir King, I
thank you that for this whole year I have lived in your
kitchen, and had meat and drink, and now I will ask you
for the two gifts that you promised me on this day.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ask them,&rdquo; answered the King. &ldquo;Sir, these shall be my
two gifts. First grant me the adventure of this damsel,
for it is mine by right.&rdquo; &ldquo;You shall have it,&rdquo; said the
King. &ldquo;Then, Sir, you shall bid Sir Lancelot du Lake
to make me Knight, for I will receive Knighthood at the
hands of no other.&rdquo; &ldquo;All this shall be done,&rdquo; said the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
King. &ldquo;Fie on you,&rdquo; cried the damsel, &ldquo;will you give me
none but a kitchen boy to rescue my lady?&rdquo; and she
went away in a rage, and mounted her horse.</p>
<p>No sooner had she left the hall than a page came to
Beaumains and told him that a horse and fair armour
had been brought for him, also there had arrived a dwarf
carrying all things that a Knight needed. And when he
was armed there were few men that were handsomer than
he, and the Court wondered greatly whence these splendid
trappings had come. Then Beaumains came into the hall,
and took farewell of the King, and Sir Gawaine and Sir
Lancelot, and prayed Sir Lancelot that he would follow
after him. So he departed, and rode after the damsel.
Many looked upon him and marvelled at the strength of
his horse, and its golden trappings, and envied Beaumains
his shining coat of mail; but they noted that he had
neither shield nor spear. &ldquo;I will ride after him,&rdquo; laughed
Sir Kay, &ldquo;and see if my kitchen boy will own me for
his better.&rdquo; &ldquo;Leave him and stay at home,&rdquo; said Sir
Gawaine and Sir Lancelot, but Sir Kay would not listen
and sprang upon his horse. Just as Beaumains came up
with the damsel, Sir Kay reached Beaumains, and said,
&ldquo;Beaumains, do you not know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beaumains turned and looked at him, and answered,
&ldquo;Yes, I know you for an ill-mannered Knight, therefore
beware of me.&rdquo; At this Sir Kay put his spear in rest and
charged him, and Beaumains drew his sword and charged
Sir Kay, and dashed aside the spear, and thrust him through
the side, till Sir Kay fell down as if he had been dead, and
Beaumains took his shield and spear for himself. Then he
sprang on his own horse, bidding first his dwarf take Sir
Kay&rsquo;s horse, and rode away. All this was seen by Sir
Lancelot, who had followed him, and also by the damsel.
In a little while Beaumains stopped, and asked Sir
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
Lancelot if he would tilt with him, and they came
together with such a shock that both the horses and
their riders fell to the earth and were bruised sorely. Sir
Lancelot was the first to rise, and he helped Beaumains
from his horse, and Beaumains threw his shield from him,
and offered to fight on foot. And they rushed together
like wild boars, turning and thrusting and parrying for the
space of an hour, and Sir Lancelot marvelled at the young
man&rsquo;s strength, and thought he was more like a giant than
a Knight, and dreading lest he himself should be put to
shame, he said: &ldquo;Beaumains, do not fight so hard, we
have no quarrel that forbids us to leave off.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is
true,&rdquo; answered Beaumains, laying down his arms, &ldquo;but
it does me good, my lord, to feel your might.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;I promise you I had much ado to save
myself from you unshamed, therefore have no fear of any
other Knight.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you think I could really stand against
a proved Knight?&rdquo; asked Beaumains. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said
Lancelot, &ldquo;if you fight as you have fought to-day I will be
your warrant against any one.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then I pray you,&rdquo; cried
Beaumains, &ldquo;give me the order of knighthood.&rdquo; &ldquo;You must
first tell me your name,&rdquo; replied Lancelot, &ldquo;and who are
your kindred.&rdquo; &ldquo;You will not betray me if I do?&rdquo; asked
Beaumains. &ldquo;No, that I will never do, till it is openly
known,&rdquo; said Lancelot. &ldquo;Then, Sir, my name is Gareth,
and Sir Gawaine is my brother.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, Sir,&rdquo; cried Lancelot,
&ldquo;I am more pleased with you than ever. I was sure you
came of good blood, and that you did not come to the
Court for meat and drink only.&rdquo; And he bade him kneel,
and gave him the order of knighthood. After that Sir
Gareth wished to go his own ways, and departed. When
he was gone, Sir Lancelot went back to Sir Kay and
ordered some men that were by to bear him home on a
shield, and in time his wounds were healed; but he was
scorned of all men, and especially of Sir Gawaine and Sir
Lancelot, who told him it was no good deed to treat any
young man so, and no one could tell what his birth might
be, or what had brought him to the Court.</p>

<img src="images/illus_032.jpg" alt="Faugh Sir! You Smell of Y^e Kitchen / Gareth &amp; Linet" width="410" height="579" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Then Beaumains rode after the damsel, who stopped
when she saw him coming. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;Your clothes smell of the grease and tallow
of the kitchen! Do you think to change my heart towards
you because of yonder Knight whom you slew? No,
truly! I know well who you are, you turner of spits!
Go back to King Arthur&rsquo;s kitchen, which is your proper
place.&rdquo; &ldquo;Damsel,&rdquo; replied Beaumains, &ldquo;you may say to
me what you will, but I shall not quit you whatever you
may do, for I have vowed to King Arthur to relieve the
lady in the castle, and I shall set her free or die fighting
for her.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fie on you, <a id="er_15" href="#ed_15">Scullion</a>,&rdquo; answered she. &ldquo;You
will meet with one who will make you such a welcome
that you would give all the broth you ever cooked never
to have seen his face.&rdquo; &ldquo;I shall do my best to fight him,&rdquo;
said Beaumains, and held his peace.</p>
<p>Soon they entered the wood, and there came a man
flying towards them, galloping with all his might. &ldquo;Oh,
help! help! lord,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;for my master lies in a
thicket, bound by six thieves, and I greatly fear they will
slay him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Show me the way,&rdquo; said Sir Beaumains, and
they rode together till they reached the place where the
Knight lay bound. Then Sir Beaumains charged the six
thieves, and struck one dead, and another, and another
still, and the other three fled, not liking the battle. Sir
Beaumains pursued them till they turned at bay, and
fought hard for their lives; but in the end Sir Beaumains
slew them, and returned to the Knight and unbound him.
The Knight thanked Beaumains heartily for his deliverance,
and prayed him to come to his castle, where he would
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
reward him. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Beaumains, &ldquo;I was this day made
Knight by noble Sir Lancelot, and that is reward enough
for anything I may do. Besides, I must follow this damsel.&rdquo;
But when he came near her she reviled him as before, and
bade him ride far from her. &ldquo;Do you think I set store by
what you have done? You will soon see a sight that will
make you tell a very different tale.&rdquo; At this the Knight
whom Beaumains had rescued rode up to the damsel, and
begged that she would rest in his castle that night, as the
sun was now setting. The damsel agreed, and the Knight
ordered a great supper, and gave Sir Beaumains a seat
above the seat of the damsel, who rose up in anger. &ldquo;Fie!
fie! Sir Knight,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;you are uncourteous to set a
mere kitchen page before me; he is not fit to be in the
company of highborn people.&rdquo; Her words struck shame
into the Knight, and he took Beaumains and set him at a
side table, and seated himself before him.</p>
<p>In the early morning Sir Beaumains and the damsel
bade farewell to the Knight, and rode through the forest
till they came to a great river, where stood two Knights
on the further side, guarding the passage. &ldquo;Well, what
do you say now?&rdquo; asked the damsel. &ldquo;Will you fight
them or turn back?&rdquo; &ldquo;I would not turn if there were
six more of them,&rdquo; answered Sir Beaumains, and he
rushed into the water and so did one of the Knights.
They came together in the middle of the stream, and their
spears broke in two with the force of the charge, and they
drew their swords, hitting hard at each other. At length
Sir Beaumains dealt the other Knight such a blow that
he fell from his horse, and was drowned in the river.
Then Beaumains put his horse at the bank, where the
second Knight was waiting for him, and they fought
long together, till Sir Beaumains clave his helmet in two.
So he left him dead, and rode after the damsel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<div class="img" id="pica4">
<img src="images/illus_035.jpg" alt="LINET AND THE BLACK KNIGHT" width="420" height="656" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;that even a kitchen page should have power to
destroy two such Knights! You think you have done
mighty things, but you are wrong! As to the first
Knight, his horse stumbled, and he was drowned before
you ever touched him. And the other you took from
behind, and struck him when he was defenceless.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Damsel!&rdquo; answered Beaumains, &ldquo;you may say what you
will, I care not what it is, so I may deliver this lady.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Fie, foul kitchen knave, you shall see Knights that will
make you lower your crest.&rdquo; &ldquo;I pray you be more civil
in your language,&rdquo; answered Beaumains, &ldquo;for it matters
not to me what Knights they be, I will do battle with
them.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am trying to turn you back for your own good,&rdquo;
answered she, &ldquo;for if you follow me you are certainly a
dead man, as well I know all you have won before has
been by luck.&rdquo; &ldquo;Say what you will, damsel,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but where you go I will follow you,&rdquo; and they rode
together till eventide, and all the way she chid him and
gave him no rest.</p>
<p>At length they reached an open space where there
was a black lawn, and on the lawn a black hawthorn,
whereon hung a black banner on one side, and a black
shield and spear, big and long, on the other. Close
by stood a black horse covered with silk, fastened to a
black stone. A Knight, covered with black armour, sat
on the horse, and when she saw him the damsel bade
him ride away, as his horse was not saddled. But the
Knight drew near and said to her, &ldquo;Damsel, have you
brought this Knight from King Arthur&rsquo;s Court to be your
champion?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, truly,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;this is but a
kitchen boy, fed by King Arthur for charity.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then why
is he clad in armour?&rdquo; asked the Knight; &ldquo;it is a shame
that he should even bear you company.&rdquo; &ldquo;I cannot be
rid of him,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;he rides with me against my will.
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
I would that you were able to deliver me from him!
Either slay him or frighten him off, for by ill fortune he
has this day slain the two Knights of the passage.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
wonder much,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, &ldquo;that any man who
is well born should consent to fight with him.&rdquo; &ldquo;They do
not know him,&rdquo; replied the damsel, &ldquo;and they think he
must be a famous Knight because he rides with me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, &ldquo;but he is well
made, and looks likely to be a strong man; still I promise
you I will just throw him to the ground, and take away
his horse and armour, for it would be a shame to me to do
more.&rdquo; When Sir Beaumains heard him talk thus he
looked up and said, &ldquo;Sir Knight, you are lightly disposing
of my horse and armour, but I would have you know that
I will pass this lawn against your will or not, and you will
only get my horse and armour if you win them in fair fight.
Therefore let me see what you can do.&rdquo; &ldquo;Say you so?&rdquo;
answered the Knight, &ldquo;now give up the lady at once, for
it ill becomes a kitchen page to ride with a lady of <a id="er_16" href="#ed_16">high degree</a>.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is a lie,&rdquo; said Beaumains, &ldquo;I am a gentleman
born, and my birth is better than yours, as I will
prove upon your body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that they drew back their horses so as to charge
each other hotly, and for the space of an hour and a half
they fought fiercely and well, but in the end a blow from
Beaumains threw the Knight from his horse, and he
swooned and died. Then Beaumains jumped down, and
seeing that the Knight&rsquo;s horse and armour were better
than his own, he took them for himself and rode after the
damsel. While they were thus riding together, and the
damsel was chiding him as ever she did, they saw a
Knight coming towards them dressed all in green. &ldquo;Is
that my brother the Black Knight who is with you?&rdquo;
asked he of the damsel. &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;this
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
unhappy kitchen knave has slain your brother, to my great
sorrow.&rdquo; &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; sighed the Green Knight, &ldquo;that my
brother should die so meanly at the hand of a kitchen
knave. Traitor!&rdquo; he added, turning to Beaumains, &ldquo;thou
shalt die for slaying my brother, for he was a noble Knight,
and his name was Sir Percard.&rdquo; &ldquo;I defy you,&rdquo; said Beaumains,
&ldquo;for I slew him as a good Knight should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Green Knight seized a horn which hung from
a thorn tree, and blew three notes upon it, and two damsels
came and armed him, and fastened on him a green shield
and a green spear. So the fight began and raged long, first
on horseback and then on foot, till both were sore wounded.
At last the damsel came and stood beside them, and said,
&ldquo;My lord the Green Knight, why for very shame do you
stand so long fighting a kitchen knave? You ought never
to have been made a Knight at all!&rdquo; These scornful
words stung the heart of the Green Knight, and he dealt
a mighty stroke which cleft asunder the shield of Beaumains.
And when Beaumains saw this, he struck a blow
upon the Knight&rsquo;s helmet which brought him to his knees,
and Beaumains leapt on him, and dragged him to the
ground. Then the Green Knight cried for mercy, and
offered to yield himself prisoner unto Beaumains. &ldquo;It is
all in vain,&rdquo; answered Beaumains, &ldquo;unless the damsel
prays me for your life,&rdquo; and therewith he unlaced his
helmet as though he would slay him. &ldquo;Fie upon thee,
false kitchen page!&rdquo; said the damsel, &ldquo;I will never pray
to save his life, for I am sure he is in no danger.&rdquo; &ldquo;Suffer
me not to die,&rdquo; entreated the Knight, &ldquo;when a word may
save me! Fair Knight,&rdquo; he went on, turning to Beaumains,
&ldquo;save my life, and I will forgive you the death of
my brother, and will do you service for ever, and will
bring thirty of my Knights to serve you likewise.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is
a shame,&rdquo; cried the damsel, &ldquo;that such a kitchen knave
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
should have you and thirty Knights besides.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo;
said Beaumains, &ldquo;I care nothing for all this, but if I am
to spare your life the damsel must ask for it,&rdquo; and he
stepped forward as if to slay him. &ldquo;Let be, foul knave,&rdquo;
then said the damsel, &ldquo;do not slay him. If you do, you
will repent it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Damsel,&rdquo; answered Beaumains, &ldquo;it is a
pleasure to me to obey you, and at your wish I will save
his life. Sir Knight with the green arms, I release you
at the request of this damsel, and I will fulfil all she
charges me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Green Knight kneeled down, and did him
homage with his sword. &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said the damsel,
&ldquo;for the wounds you have received, and for your brother&rsquo;s
death, for I had great need of you both, and have much
dread of passing the forest.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fear nothing,&rdquo; answered
the Green Knight, &ldquo;for this evening you shall lodge in my
house, and to-morrow I will show you the way through
the forest.&rdquo; And they went with the Green Knight. But
the damsel did not mend her ways with Beaumains, and
ever more reviled him, till the Green Knight rebuked her,
saying Beaumains was the noblest Knight that held a
spear, and that in the end she would find he had sprung
from some great King. And the Green Knight summoned
the thirty Knights who did him service, and bade them
henceforth do service to Beaumains, and guard him from
treachery, and when he had need of them they would be
ready to obey his orders. So they bade each other farewell,
and Beaumains and the damsel rode forth anew. In
like manner did Sir Beaumains overcome the Red Knight,
who was the third brother, and the Red Knight cried for
mercy, and offered to bring sixty Knights to do him
service, and Beaumains spared his life at the request of the
damsel, and likewise it so happened to Sir Persant of Inde.</p>
<p>And this time the damsel prayed Beaumains to give
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
up the fight, saying, &ldquo;Sir, I wonder who you are and of
what kindred you have come. Boldly you speak, and
boldly you have done; therefore I pray you to depart and
save yourself while you may, for both you and your horse
have suffered great fatigues, and I fear we delay too long,
for the besieged castle is but seven miles from this place,
and all the perils are past save this one only. I dread sorely
lest you should get some hurt; yet this Sir Persant of Inde
is nothing in might to the Knight who has laid siege to my
lady.&rdquo; But Sir Beaumains would not listen to her words,
and vowed that by two hours after noon he would have
overthrown him, and that it would still be daylight when
they reached the castle. &ldquo;What sort of a man can you
be?&rdquo; answered the damsel, looking at him in wonder, &ldquo;for
never did a woman treat a Knight as ill and shamefully
as I have done you, while you have always been gentle
and courteous to me, and no one bears himself like that
save he who is of noble blood.&rdquo; &ldquo;Damsel,&rdquo; replied Beaumains,
&ldquo;your hard words only drove me to strike the harder,
and though I ate in King Arthur&rsquo;s kitchen, perhaps I might
have had as much food as I wanted elsewhere. But all I
have done was to make proof of my friends, and whether
I am a gentleman or not, fair damsel, I have done you
gentleman&rsquo;s service, and may perchance do you greater
service before we part from each other.&rdquo; &ldquo;Alas, fair
Beaumains, forgive me all that I have said and done
against you.&rdquo; &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and
since you are pleased now to speak good words to me, know
that I hear them gladly, and there is no Knight living but
I feel strong enough to meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Beaumains conquered Sir Persant of Inde, who
brought a hundred Knights to be sworn into his service,
and the next morning the damsel led him to the castle,
where the Red Knight of the Red Lawn held fast the lady.
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
&ldquo;Heaven defend you,&rdquo; cried Sir Persant, when they told
him where they were going; &ldquo;that is the most perilous
Knight now living, for he has the strength of seven men.
He has done great wrong to that lady, who is one of the
fairest in all the world, and it seems to me that this
damsel must be her sister. Is not her name Linet?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;and my lady my sister&rsquo;s name
is dame Lyonesse.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Red Knight has drawn out the
siege for two years,&rdquo; said Sir Persant, &ldquo;though he might
have forced an entrance many a time, but he hoped that
Sir Lancelot du Lake or Sir Tristram or Sir Gawaine
should come to do battle with him.&rdquo; &ldquo;My Lord Sir
Persant of Inde,&rdquo; said the damsel, &ldquo;I bid you knight this
gentleman before he fight with the Red Knight.&rdquo; &ldquo;That
I will gladly,&rdquo; replied Sir Persant, &ldquo;if it please him to
take the order of knighthood from so simple a man as
I am.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Beaumains, &ldquo;I thank you for
your goodwill, but at the beginning of this quest I was
made a Knight by Sir Lancelot. My name is Sir Gareth
of Orkney and Sir Gawaine is my brother, though neither
he nor King Arthur, whose sister is my mother, knows of it.
I pray you to keep it close also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now word was brought unto the besieged lady by the
dwarf that her sister was coming to her with a Knight
sent by King Arthur. And when the lady heard all that
Beaumains had done, and how he had overthrown all
who stood in his way, she bade her dwarf take baked
<a id="er_17" href="#ed_17">venison</a>, and fat <a id="er_18" href="#ed_18">capons</a>, and two silver flagons of wine and
a gold cup, and put them into the hands of a hermit that
dwelt in a hermitage close by. The dwarf did so, and the
lady then sent him to greet her sister and Sir Beaumains,
and to beg them to eat and drink in the hermit&rsquo;s cell, and
rest themselves, which they did. When they drew near
the besieged castle Sir Beaumains saw full forty Knights,
with spurs on their heels and swords in their hands, hanging
from the tall trees that stood upon the lawn. &ldquo;Fair Sir,&rdquo;
said the damsel, &ldquo;these Knights came hither to rescue
my sister, dame Lyonesse; and if you cannot overthrow
the Knight of the Red Lawn, you will hang there too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<div class="img" id="pica5">
<img src="images/illus_042.jpg" alt="The Lady of Lyonesse sees Sir Gareth" width="428" height="679" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; answered Beaumains, &ldquo;it is a marvel that
none of King Arthur&rsquo;s Knights has dealt with the Knight
of the Red Lawn ere this;&rdquo; and they rode up to the castle,
which had round it high walls and deep ditches, till they
came to a great sycamore tree, where hung a horn. And
whoso desired to do battle with the Red Knight must blow
that horn loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I pray you,&rdquo; said Linet, as Beaumains bent forward
to seize it, &ldquo;do not blow it till it is full noontide, for
during three hours before that the Red Knight&rsquo;s strength
so increases that it is as the strength of seven men; but
when noon is come, he has the might of one man only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! for shame, damsel, to say such words. I will
fight him as he is, or not at all,&rdquo; and Beaumains blew such
a blast that it rang through the castle. And the Red
Knight buckled on his armour, and came to where
Beaumains stood. So the battle began, and a fierce one it
was, and much ado had Beaumains to last out till noon,
when the Red Knight&rsquo;s strength began to wane; they
rested, and came on again, and in the end the Red Knight
yielded to Sir Beaumains, and the lords and barons in the
castle did homage to the victor, and begged that the Red
Knight&rsquo;s life might be spared on condition they all took
service with Beaumains. This was granted to them, and
Linet bound up his wounds and put ointment on them,
and so she did likewise to Sir Beaumains. But the Red
Knight was sent to the Court of King Arthur, and told
him all that Sir Beaumains had done. And King Arthur
and his Knights marvelled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Now Sir Beaumains had looked up at the windows of
Castle Perilous before the fight, and had seen the face of
the Lady Lyonesse, and had thought it the fairest in all
the world. After he had subdued the Red Knight, he
hasted into the castle, and the Lady Lyonesse welcomed
him, and he told her he had bought her love with the best
blood in his body. And she did not say him nay, but put
him off for a time. Then the King sent letters to her to
bid her, and likewise Sir Gareth, come to his Court, and by
the counsel of Sir Gareth she prayed the King to let her
call a tournament, and to proclaim that the Knight who
bore himself best should, if he was unwedded, take her
and all her lands. But if he had a wife already he should
be given a white <a id="er_19" href="#ed_19">ger-falcon</a>, and for his wife a crown of
gold, set about with precious stones.</p>
<p>So the Lady Lyonesse did as Sir Gareth had counselled
her, and answered King Arthur that where Sir Gareth
was she could not tell, but that if the King would call a
tourney he might be sure that Sir Gareth would come to
it. &ldquo;It is well thought of,&rdquo; said Arthur, and the Lady
Lyonesse departed unto Castle Perilous, and summoned
all her Knights around her, and told them what she had
done, and how they were to make ready to fight in the
tournament. She began at once to set her castle in order,
and to think what she should do with the great array of
Knights that would ride hither from the furthest parts&mdash;from
Scotland and Wales and Cornwall&mdash;and to lodge
fitly the Kings, Dukes, Earls, and Barons that should come
with Arthur. Queen Guenevere also she awaited, and the
Queen of Orkney, Sir Gareth&rsquo;s mother. But Sir Gareth
entreated the Lady Lyonesse and those Knights that were
in the castle with him not to let his name be known, and
this they agreed to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Gareth,&rdquo; said dame Lyonesse, &ldquo;I will lend you
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
a ring, which I beseech you for the love you bear me to
give me back when the tournament is done, for without it
I have but little beauty. This ring is like no other ring,
it will turn green red, and blue white, and the bearer shall
lose no blood, however sore he may be wounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, my own lady,&rdquo; answered Sir Gareth, &ldquo;this
ring will serve me well, and by its help I shall not fear
that any man shall know me.&rdquo; And Sir Gringamore,
brother to the Lady Lyonesse, gave him a bay horse, and
strong armour, and a sharp sword that had once belonged
to his father. On the morning of the fifteenth of August,
when the <a id="er_20" href="#ed_20">Feast of the Assumption</a> was kept, the King
commanded his heralds to blow loudly their trumpets, so
that every Knight might know that he must enter the
lists. It was a noble sight to see them flocking clad in
shining armour, each man with his <a id="er_21" href="#ed_21">device</a> upon his shield.
And the heralds marked who <a id="er_22" href="#ed_22">bare them</a> best, and who
were overthrown. All marvelled as to who the Knight
could be whose armour sometimes seemed green, and
sometimes white, but no man knew it was Sir Gareth.
And whosoever Sir Gareth tilted with was straightway
overthrown. &ldquo;Of a truth,&rdquo; cried King Arthur, &ldquo;that
Knight with the many colours is a good Knight,&rdquo; and he
called Sir Lancelot and bade him to challenge that Knight
to combat. But Sir Lancelot said that though the Knight
had come off victor in every fight, yet his limbs must be
weary, for he had fought as a man fights under the eyes
of his lady, &ldquo;and for this day,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;he
shall have the honour. Though it lay in my power to put
it from him, I would not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they paused for a while to rest, and afterwards
the tournament began again more fiercely than before,
and Sir Lancelot was set upon by two Knights at once.
When Sir Gareth saw that, he rode in between them, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
no stroke would he deal Sir Lancelot, which Sir Lancelot
noted, and guessed that it was the good Knight Sir Gareth.
Sir Gareth went hither and thither, smiting any one that
came in his way, and by fortune he met with his brother
Sir Gawaine, and knocked off his helmet. Now it happened
that while he was fighting a Knight dealt Sir
Gareth a fierce blow on his helm, and he rode off the field
to mend it. Then his dwarf who had been watching
eagerly, cried out to Sir Gareth to leave the ring with him,
lest he should lose it while he was drinking, which Sir
Gareth did; and when he had drunk and mended his helm
he forgot the ring, at which the dwarf was glad, for he
knew his name could no longer be hid. And when Sir
Gareth returned to the field, his armour shone yellow like
gold, and King Arthur marvelled what Knight he was, for
he saw by his hair that he was the same Knight who had
worn the many colours. &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he said to his heralds,
&ldquo;ride near him and see what manner of Knight he is, for
none can tell me his name.&rdquo; So a herald drew close to
him, and saw that on his helm was written in golden
letters &ldquo;This helm belongs to Sir Gareth of Orkney&rdquo;; and
the herald cried out and made proclamation, and the Kings
and Knights pressed to behold him. And when Sir
Gareth saw he was discovered, he struck more fiercely
than before, and smote down Sir Sagramore, and his
brother Sir Gawaine. &ldquo;O brother,&rdquo; said Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;I
did not think you would have smitten me!&rdquo; When Sir
Gareth heard him say that he rode out of the press, and
cried to his dwarf, &ldquo;Boy, you have played me foul, for
you have kept my ring. Give it to me now, that I may
hide myself,&rdquo; and he galloped swiftly into the forest, and
no one knew where he had gone. &ldquo;What shall I do
next?&rdquo; asked he of the dwarf. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered the
dwarf, &ldquo;send the Lady Lyonesse back her ring.&rdquo; &ldquo;Your
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
counsel is good,&rdquo; said Gareth; &ldquo;take it to her, and commend
me to her grace, and say I will come when I may,
and bid her to be faithful to me, as I am to her.&rdquo; After
that Sir Gareth rode deeper into the forest.</p>
<p>Though Sir Gareth had left the tournament he found
that there were as many fights awaiting him as if he had
remained there. He overcame all his foes, and sent them
and their followers to do homage to King Arthur, but he
himself stayed behind. He was standing alone after they
had gone, when he beheld an armed Knight coming towards
him. Sir Gareth sprang on his horse, and without
a word the two crashed together like thunder, and strove
hard for two hours, till the ground was wet with blood.
At that time the damsel Linet came riding by, and saw
what was doing, and knew who were the fighters. And
she cried &ldquo;Sir Gawaine, Sir Gawaine, leave fighting with
your brother Sir Gareth.&rdquo; Then he threw down his shield
and sword, and ran to Sir Gareth, and first took him in
his arms and next kneeled down and asked mercy of him.
&ldquo;Why do you, who were but now so strong and mighty,
so suddenly yield to me?&rdquo; asked Sir Gareth, who had not
perceived the damsel. &ldquo;O Gareth, I am your brother, and
have had much sorrow for your sake.&rdquo; At this Sir Gareth
unlaced his helm and knelt before Sir Gawaine, and they
rose and embraced each other. &ldquo;Ah, my fair brother,&rdquo;
said Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;I ought rightly to do you homage, even
if you were not my brother, for in this twelvemonth you
have sent King Arthur more Knights than any six of the
best men of the Round Table.&rdquo; While he was speaking
there came the Lady Linet, and healed the wounds of
Sir Gareth and of Sir Gawaine. &ldquo;What are you going to do
now?&rdquo; asked she. &ldquo;It is time that King Arthur had tidings
of you both, and your horses are not fit to bear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride, I pray you,&rdquo; said Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;to my uncle King
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
Arthur, who is but two miles away, and tell him what adventure
has befallen me.&rdquo; So she mounted her mule, and
when she had told her tale to King Arthur, he bade them
saddle him a palfrey and invited all the Knights and
ladies of his Court to ride with him. When they reached
the place they saw Sir Gareth and Sir Gawaine sitting on
the hill-side. The King jumped off his horse, and would
have greeted them, but he swooned away for gladness,
and they ran and comforted him, and also their mother.</p>
<p>The two Knights stayed in King Arthur&rsquo;s Court for
eight days, and rested themselves and grew strong. Then
said the King to Linet, &ldquo;I wonder that your sister, dame
Lyonesse, does not come here to visit me, or more truly
to visit my nephew, Sir Gareth, who has worked so hard
to win her love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; answered Linet, &ldquo;you must, by your grace, hold
her excused, for she does not know that Sir Gareth is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and fetch her, then,&rdquo; said Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will do quickly,&rdquo; replied Linet, and by the
next morning she had brought dame Lyonesse, and her
brother Sir Gringamore, and forty Knights, but among the
ladies dame Lyonesse was the fairest, save only Queen
Guenevere. They were all welcomed of King Arthur,
who turned to his nephew Sir Gareth and asked him
whether he would have that lady to his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; replied Sir Gareth, &ldquo;you know well that I
love her above all the ladies in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what say you, fair lady?&rdquo; asked the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most noble King,&rdquo; said dame Lyonesse, &ldquo;I would
sooner have Sir Gareth as my husband than any King
or Prince that may be christened, and if I may not have
him I promise you I will have none. For he is my first
love, and shall be my last. And if you will suffer him to
have his will and choice, I dare say he will have me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is truth,&rdquo; said Sir Gareth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, nephew,&rdquo; cried the King, &ldquo;sits the wind in
that door? Then you shall have all the help that is in
my power,&rdquo; and so said Gareth&rsquo;s mother. And it was
fixed that the marriage should be at <a id="er_23" href="#ed_23">Michaelmas</a>, at Kin-Kenadon
by the seashore, and thus it was proclaimed in
all places of the realm. Then Sir Gareth sent his summons
to all the Knights and ladies that he had won in
battle that they should be present, and he gave a rich ring
to the Lady Lyonesse, and she gave him one likewise.
And before she departed she had from King Arthur a
shining golden bee, as a token. After that Sir Gareth set
her on her way towards her castle, and returned unto the
King. But he would ever be in Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s company,
for there was no Knight that Sir Gareth loved so well as
Sir Lancelot. The days drew fast to Michaelmas, and
there came the Lady Lyonesse with her sister Linet and
her brother Sir Gringamore to Kin-Kenadon by the sea,
and there were they lodged by order of King Arthur.
And upon Michaelmas Day the Bishop of Canterbury
wedded Sir Gareth and the Lady Lyonesse with great
ceremonies, and King Arthur commanded that Sir Gawaine
should be joined to the damsel Linet, and Sir Agrawaine
to the niece of dame Lyonesse, whose name was Laurel.
Then the Knights whom Sir Gareth had won in battle
came with their followings and did homage to him, and
the Green Knight besought him that he might act as
<a id="er_24" href="#ed_24">chamberlain</a> at the feast, and the Red Knight that he
might be his steward. As soon as the feast was ended,
they had all manner of minstrelsy and games and a great
tournament that lasted three days, but at the prayer of
dame Lyonesse the King would not suffer that any man
who was wedded should fight at that feast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />HOW MORGAN LE FAY TRIED TO KILL KING ARTHUR.</h2>
<p>King Arthur had a sister called Morgan le Fay, who was
skilled in magic of all sorts, and hated her brother because
he had slain in battle a Knight whom she loved. The
better to gain her own ends, and to revenge herself upon
the King, she kept a smiling face, and let none guess the
passion in her heart.</p>
<p>One day Morgan le Fay went to Queen Guenevere, and
asked her leave to go into the country. The Queen wished
her to wait till Arthur returned, but Morgan le Fay said
she had had bad news and could not wait. Then the
Queen let her depart without delay.</p>
<p>Early next morning at break of day Morgan le Fay
mounted her horse and rode all day and all night, and at
noon next day reached the Abbey of nuns where King
Arthur had gone to rest, for he had fought a hard battle,
and for three nights had slept but little. &ldquo;Do not wake
him,&rdquo; said Morgan le Fay, who had come there knowing she
would find him, &ldquo;I will rouse him myself when I think he
has had enough sleep,&rdquo; for she thought to steal his sword
Excalibur from him. The nuns dared not disobey her, so
Morgan le Fay went straight into the room where King
Arthur was lying fast asleep in his bed, and in his right
hand was grasped his sword Excalibur. When she beheld
that sight, her heart fell, for she dared not touch the
sword, knowing well that if Arthur waked and saw her
she was a dead woman. So she took the scabbard, and
went away on horseback.</p>
<p>When the King awoke and missed his scabbard, he
was angry, and asked who had been there; and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
nuns told him that it was his sister Morgan le Fay,
who had gone away with a scabbard under her mantle.&mdash;&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;
said Arthur, &ldquo;you have watched me badly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;we dared not disobey your sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saddle the best horse that can be found,&rdquo; commanded
the King, &ldquo;and bid Sir Ontzlake take another and come
with me.&rdquo; And they buckled on their armour and rode
after Morgan le Fay.</p>
<p>They had not gone far before they met a cowherd, and
they stopped to ask if he had seen any lady riding that way.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the cowherd, &ldquo;a lady passed by here, with
forty horses behind her, and went into the forest yonder.&rdquo;
Then they galloped hard till Arthur caught sight of Morgan
le Fay, who looked back, and, seeing that it was Arthur
who gave chase, pushed on faster than before. And when
she saw she could not escape him, she rode into a lake that
lay in the plain on the edge of the forest, and, crying out,
&ldquo;Whatever may befall me, my brother shall not have the
scabbard,&rdquo; she threw the scabbard far into the water, and
it sank, for it was heavy with gold and jewels. After that
she fled into a valley full of great stones, and turned herself
and her men and her horses into blocks of marble.
Scarcely had she done this when the King rode up, but
seeing her nowhere thought some evil must have befallen
her in vengeance of her misdeeds. He then sought high
and low for the scabbard, but being unable to find it, he
returned to the Abbey. When Arthur was gone, Morgan
le Fay turned herself and her horses and her men back
into their former shapes and said, &ldquo;Now, Sirs, we may go
where we will.&rdquo; And she departed into the country of
<a id="er_25" href="#ed_25">Gore</a>, and made her towns and castles stronger than before,
for she feared King Arthur greatly. Meanwhile King
Arthur had rested himself at the Abbey, and afterwards
he rode to Camelot, and was welcomed by his Queen and
all his Knights. And when he told his adventures and
how Morgan le Fay sought his death they longed to burn
her for her treason.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The next morning there arrived a damsel at the Court
with a message from Morgan le Fay, saying that she had
sent the King her brother a rich mantle for a gift, covered
with precious stones, and begged him to receive it and to
forgive her in whatever she might have offended him. The
King answered little, but the mantle pleased him, and he
was about to throw it over his shoulders when the Lady of
the Lake stepped forward, and begged that she might
speak to him in private. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the King.
&ldquo;Say on here, and fear nothing.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the lady,
&ldquo;do not put on this mantle, or suffer your Knights to put
it on, till the bringer of it has worn it in your presence.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Your words are wise,&rdquo; answered the King, &ldquo;I will do as
you counsel me. Damsel, I desire you to put on this
mantle that you have brought me, so that I may see it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it does not become me to wear a King&rsquo;s
garment.&rdquo; &ldquo;By my head,&rdquo; cried Arthur, &ldquo;you shall wear
it before I put it on my back, or on the back of any of my
Knights,&rdquo; and he signed to them to put it on her, and she
fell down dead, burnt to ashes by the enchanted mantle.
Then the King was filled with anger, more bitter than
before, that his sister should have dealt so wickedly by
him.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><br />THE PASSING OF MERLIN.</h2>
<p>Many of King Arthur&rsquo;s Knights set out on journeys in
search of adventure, and one of them, Sir Pellinore,
brought a damsel of the lake to Arthur&rsquo;s Court, and when
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
Merlin saw her he fell in love with her, so that he desired
to be always in her company. The damsel laughed in
secret at Merlin, but made use of him to tell her all she
would know, and the wizard had no strength to say her
nay, though he knew what would come of it. For he
told King Arthur that before long he should be put into
the earth alive, for all his cunning. He likewise told the
King many things that should befall him, and warned
him always to keep the scabbard as well as the sword
Excalibur, and foretold that both sword and scabbard
should be stolen from him by a woman whom he most
trusted. &ldquo;You will miss my counsel sorely,&rdquo; added
Merlin, &ldquo;and would give all your lands to have me back
again.&rdquo; &ldquo;But since you know what will happen,&rdquo; said
the King, &ldquo;you may surely guard against it.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
answered Merlin, &ldquo;that will not be.&rdquo; So he departed
from the King, and the maiden followed him whom some
call <a id="er_26" href="#ed_26">Nimue</a> and others Vivien, and wherever she went
Merlin went also.</p>
<p>They journeyed together to many places, both at home
and across the seas, and the damsel was wearied of him,
and sought by every means to be rid of him, but he would
not be shaken off. At last these two wandered back to
Cornwall, and one day Merlin showed Vivien a rock
under which he said great marvels were hidden. Then
Vivien put forth all her powers, and told Merlin how she
longed to see the wonders beneath the stone, and, in spite
of all his wisdom, Merlin listened to her and crept under
the rock to bring forth the strange things that lay there.
And when he was under the stone she used the magic he
had taught her, and the rock rolled over him, and buried
him alive, as he had told King Arthur. But the damsel
departed with joy, and thought no more of him, now that
she knew all the magic he could teach her.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><br />PART II.
<br />THE QUEST OF THE <a id="er_27" href="#ed_27">HOLY GRAAL</a>.</h2>
<h3 title="">I.
<br />How the King went on Pilgrimage and his Squire was slain in a Dream.</h3>
<p>Now the King was minded to go on a pilgrimage, and he
agreed with the Queen that he would set forth to seek the
holy chapel at St. Augustine, which is in the White
Forest, and may only be found by adventure. Much he
wished to undertake the quest alone, but this the Queen
would not suffer, and to do her pleasure he consented that
a youth, tall and strong of limb, should ride with him as
his squire. Chaus was the youth&rsquo;s name, and he was son
to Gwain li Aoutres. &ldquo;Lie within to-night,&rdquo; commanded
the King, &ldquo;and take heed that my horse be saddled at
break of day, and my arms ready.&rdquo; &ldquo;At your pleasure,
Sir,&rdquo; answered the youth, whose heart rejoiced because he
was going alone with the King.</p>
<p>As night came on, all the Knights quitted the hall, but
Chaus the squire stayed where he was, and would not take
off his clothes or his shoes, lest sleep should fall on him
and he might not be ready when the King called him. So
he sat himself down by the great fire, but in spite of his
will sleep fell heavily on him, and he dreamed a strange
dream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>In his dream it seemed that the King had ridden away
to the quest, and had left his squire behind him, which
filled the young man with fear. And in his dream he set
the saddle and bridle on his horse, and fastened his spurs,
and girt on his sword, and galloped out of the castle after
the King. He rode on a long space, till he entered a thick
forest, and there before him lay traces of the King&rsquo;s horse,
and he followed till the marks of the hoofs ceased suddenly
at some open ground and he thought that the King had
alighted there. On the right stood a chapel, and about it
was a graveyard, and in the graveyard many coffins, and
in his dream it seemed as if the King had entered the
chapel, so the young man entered also. But no man did
he behold save a Knight that lay dead upon a bier in the
midst of the chapel, covered with a <a id="er_28" href="#ed_28">pall</a> of rich silk, and
four tapers in golden candlesticks were burning round
him. The squire marvelled to see the body lying there so
lonely, with no one near it, and likewise that the King was
nowhere to be seen. Then he took out one of the tall
tapers, and hid the candlestick under his cloak, and rode
away until he should find the King.</p>
<p>On his journey through the forest he was stopped by
a man black and <a id="er_29" href="#ed_29">ill-favoured</a>, holding a large knife in his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! you that stand there, have you seen King
Arthur?&rdquo; asked the squire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I have met you, and I am glad thereof, for
you have under your cloak one of the candlesticks of gold
that was placed in honour of the Knight who lies dead in
the chapel. Give it to me, and I will carry it back; and
if you do not this of your own will, I will make you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my faith!&rdquo; cried the squire, &ldquo;I will never yield
it to you! Rather, will I carry it off and make a present
of it to King Arthur.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will pay for it dearly,&rdquo; answered the man, &ldquo;if
you yield it not up forthwith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this the squire did not make answer, but dashed
forward, thinking to pass him by; but the man thrust at
him with his knife, and it entered his body up to the hilt.
And when the squire dreamed this, he cried, &ldquo;Help! help!
for I am a dead man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the King and the Queen heard that cry
they awoke from their sleep, and the Chamberlain said,
&ldquo;Sir, you must be moving, for it is day;&rdquo; and the King
rose and dressed himself, and put on his shoes. Then the
cry came again: &ldquo;Fetch me a priest, for I die!&rdquo; and the
King ran at great speed into the hall, while the Queen
and the Chamberlain followed him with torches and
candles. &ldquo;What aileth you?&rdquo; asked the King of his
squire, and the squire told him of all that he had dreamed.
&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;is it, then, a dream?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo;
answered the squire, &ldquo;but it is a right foul dream for me,
for right foully it hath come true,&rdquo; and he lifted his left
arm, and said, &ldquo;Sir, look you here! Lo, here is the knife
that was struck in my side up to the haft.&rdquo; After that, he
drew forth the candlestick, and showed it to the King.
&ldquo;Sir, for this candlestick that I present to you was I
wounded to the death!&rdquo; The King took the candlestick
in his hands and looked at it, and none so rich had he
seen before, and he bade the Queen look also. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said
the squire again, &ldquo;draw not forth the knife out of my
body till I be <a id="er_30" href="#ed_30">shriven</a> of the priest.&rdquo; So the King commanded
that a priest should be sent for, and when the
squire had confessed his sins, the King drew the knife out
of the body and the soul departed forthwith. Then the
King grieved that the young man had come to his death
in such strange <a id="er_31" href="#ed_31">wise</a>, and ordered him a fair burial, and
desired that the golden candlestick should be sent to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
Church of Saint Paul in London, which at that time was
newly built.</p>
<p>After this King Arthur would have none to go with
him on his quest, and many strange adventures he
achieved before he reached the chapel of St. Augustine,
which was in the midst of the White Forest. There he
alighted from his horse, and sought to enter, but though
there was neither door nor bar he might not pass the
threshold. But from without be heard wondrous voices
singing, and saw a light shining brighter than any that
he had seen before, and visions such as he scarcely dared
to look upon. And he resolved greatly to amend his sins,
and to bring peace and order into his kingdom. So he
set forth, strengthened and comforted, and after <a id="er_32" href="#ed_32">divers</a>
more adventures returned to his Court.</p>
<h3 title="">II.
<br />The Coming of the Holy Graal.</h3>
<p>It was on the eve of Pentecost that all the Knights of
the Table Round met together at Camelot, and a great
feast was made ready for them. And as they sat at
supper they heard a loud noise, as of the crashing of
thunder, and it seemed as if the roof would fall on them.
Then, in the midst of the thunder, there entered a sunbeam,
brighter by seven times than the brightest day,
and its brightness was not of this world. The Knights
held their peace, but every man looked at his neighbour,
and his countenance shone fairer than ever it had done
before. As they sat dumb, for their tongues felt as if
they could speak nothing, there floated in the hall the
Holy Graal, and over it a veil of white <a id="er_33" href="#ed_33">samite</a>, so that
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
none might see it nor who bare it. But sweet odours
filled the place, and every Knight had set before him the
food he loved best; and after that the Holy Vessel
departed suddenly, they <a id="er_34" href="#ed_34">wist</a> not where. When it had
gone their tongues were loosened, and the King gave
thanks for the wonders that they had been permitted to
see. After that he had finished, Sir Gawaine stood up and
vowed to depart the next morning in quest of the Holy
Graal, and not to return until he had seen it. &ldquo;But if
after a year and a day I may not speed in my quest,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I shall come again, for I shall know that the sight of
it is not for me.&rdquo; And many of the Knights there sitting
swore a like vow.</p>
<p>But King Arthur, when he heard this, was sore displeased.
&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cried he unto Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;you have
undone me by your vow. For through you is broken up
the fairest fellowship, and the truest of knighthood, that
ever the world saw, and when they have once departed
they shall meet no more at the Table Round, for many
shall die in the quest. It grieves me sore, for I have
loved them as well as my own life.&rdquo; So he spoke, and
paused, and tears came into his eyes. &ldquo;Ah, Gawaine,
Gawaine! you have set me in great sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comfort yourself,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;for we shall
win for ourselves great honour, much more if we die in
this wise than in any other, since die we must.&rdquo; But
the King would not be comforted, and the Queen and all
the Court were troubled also for the love which they bore
these Knights. Now among the company sat a young
Knight whose name was <a id="er_35" href="#ed_35">Galahad</a>. He had already
achieved fame by his deeds in the field and tourney, and
the Queen marvelled at the likeness he bore to Sir Lancelot.
She asked him whence he came, and of what country,
and if he was son to Sir Lancelot. And King Arthur did

him great honour, and he rested him in his own bed.
And next morning the King and Queen went into the
Minster, and the Knights followed them, dressed all in
armour, save only their shields and their helmets. When
the service was finished the King would know how many
of the fellowship had sworn to undertake the quest of the
Graal, and they were counted, and found to number a
hundred and fifty. They bade farewell, and mounted
their horses, and rode through the streets of Camelot, and
there was weeping of both rich and poor, and the King
could not speak for weeping. And at sunrise they all
parted company with each other, and every Knight took
the way he best liked.</p>
<h3 title="">III.
<br />The Adventure of Sir Galahad.</h3>
<p>Now Sir Galahad had as yet no shield, and he rode four
days without meeting any adventure, till at last he came
to a <a id="er_36" href="#ed_36">White Abbey</a>, where he dismounted and asked if he
might sleep there that night. The brethren received him
with great reverence, and led him to a chamber, where he
took off his armour, and then saw that he was in the
presence of two Knights. &ldquo;Sirs,&rdquo; said Sir Galahad, &ldquo;what
adventure brought you hither?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied they, &ldquo;we
heard that within this Abbey is a shield that no man may
hang round his neck without being dead within three days,
or some mischief befalling him. And if we fail in the
adventure, you shall take it upon you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sirs,&rdquo; replied
Sir Galahad, &ldquo;I agree well thereto, for as yet I have no
shield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So on the morn they arose and heard <a id="er_37" href="#ed_37">Mass</a>, and then
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
a monk led them behind an altar where hung a shield
white as snow, with a red cross in the middle of it.
&ldquo;Sirs,&rdquo; said the monk, &ldquo;this shield can be hung round
no Knight&rsquo;s neck, unless he be the worthiest Knight
in the world, and therefore I counsel you to be well
advised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered one of the Knights, whose name
was King Bagdemagus, &ldquo;I know truly that I am not the
best Knight in the world, but yet shall I try to bear it,&rdquo;
and he bore it out of the Abbey. Then he said to Sir
Galahad, &ldquo;I pray you abide here still, till you know how
I shall speed,&rdquo; and he rode away, taking with him a squire
to send tidings back to Sir Galahad.</p>
<p>After King Bagdemagus had ridden two miles he
entered a fair valley, and there met him a goodly Knight
seated on a white horse and clad in white armour. And
they came together with their spears, and Sir Bagdemagus
was borne from his horse, for the shield covered him not
at all. Therewith the strange Knight alighted and took
the white shield from him, and gave it to the squire, saying,
&ldquo;Bear this shield to the good Knight Sir Galahad
that thou hast left in the Abbey, and greet him well from
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;what is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take thou no heed of my name,&rdquo; answered the
Knight, &ldquo;for it is not for thee to know, nor for any earthly
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, fair Sir,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;tell me for what
cause this shield may not be borne lest ill befalls him who
bears it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you have asked me,&rdquo; answered the Knight,
&ldquo;know that no man shall bear this shield, save Sir
Galahad only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the squire turned to Bagdemagus, and asked
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
him whether he were wounded or not. &ldquo;Yes, truly,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;and I shall hardly escape from death;&rdquo; and scarcely
could he climb on to his horse&rsquo;s back when the squire
brought it near him. But the squire led him to a monastery
that lay in the valley, and there he was treated of
his wounds, and after long lying came back to life. After
the squire had given the Knight into the care of the
monks, he rode back to the Abbey, bearing with him the
shield. &ldquo;Sir Galahad,&rdquo; said he, alighting before him,
&ldquo;the Knight that wounded Bagdemagus sends you greeting,
and bids you bear this shield, which shall bring you many
adventures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now blessed be God and fortune,&rdquo; answered Sir
Galahad, and called for his arms, and mounted his horse,
hanging the shield about his neck. Then, followed by
the squire, he set out. They rode straight to the hermitage,
where they saw the White Knight who had sent
the shield to Sir Galahad. The two Knights saluted each
other courteously, and then the White Knight told Sir
Galahad the story of the shield, and how it had been given
into his charge. Afterwards they parted, and Sir Galahad
and his squire returned unto the Abbey whence they
came.</p>
<p>The monks made great joy at seeing Sir Galahad
again, for they feared he was gone for ever; and as soon as
he was alighted from his horse they brought him unto a
tomb in the churchyard where there was night and day
such a noise that any man who heard it would be driven
nigh mad, or else lose his strength. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we
deem it a fiend.&rdquo; Sir Galahad drew near, all armed save
his helmet, and stood by the tomb. &ldquo;Lift up the stone,&rdquo;
said a monk, and Galahad lifted it, and a voice cried,
&ldquo;Come thou not nigh me, Sir Galahad, for thou shalt
make me go again where I have been so long.&rdquo; But
Galahad took no heed of him, and lifted the stone yet
higher, and there rushed from the tomb a foul smoke, and
in the midst of it leaped out the foulest figure that ever
was seen in the likeness of a man. &ldquo;Galahad,&rdquo; said the
figure, &ldquo;I see about thee so many angels that my power
dare not touch thee.&rdquo; Then Galahad, stooping down,
looked into the tomb, and he saw a body all armed lying
there, with a sword by his side. &ldquo;Fair brother,&rdquo; said
Galahad, &ldquo;let us remove this body, for he is not worthy to
be in this churchyard, being a false Christian man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<div class="img" id="pica8">
<img src="images/illus_064.jpg" alt="SIR GALAHAD opens the tomb" width="413" height="604" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>This being done they all departed and returned unto
the monastery, where they lay that night, and the next
morning Sir Galahad knighted Melias his squire, as he had
promised him aforetime. So Sir Galahad and Sir Melias
departed thence, in quest of the Holy Graal, but they
soon went their different ways and fell upon different
adventures. In his first encounter Sir Melias was sore
wounded, and Sir Galahad came to his help, and left him
to an old monk who said that he would heal him of his
wounds in the space of seven weeks, and that he was thus
wounded because he had not come clean to the quest of
the Graal, as Sir Galahad had done. Sir Galahad left
him there, and rode on till he came to the Castle of
Maidens, which he alone might enter who was free from
sin. There he chased away the Knights who had seized
the castle seven years agone, and restored all to the
Duke&rsquo;s daughter, who owned it of right. Besides this he
set free the maidens who were kept in prison, and summoned
all those Knights in the country round who had
held their lands of the Duke, bidding them do homage to
his daughter. And in the morning one came to him and
told him that as the seven Knights fled from the Castle of
Maidens they fell upon the path of Sir Gawaine, Sir
Gareth, and Sir Lewaine, who were seeking Sir Galahad,
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
and they gave battle: and the seven Knights were slain
by the three Knights. &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Galahad, and he
took his armour and his horse and rode away.</p>
<p>So when Sir Galahad left the Castle of Maidens he
rode till he came to a waste forest, and there he met with
Sir Lancelot and Sir Percivale; but they knew him not,
for he was now disguised. And they fought together, and
the two knights were smitten down out of the saddle.
&ldquo;God be with thee, thou best Knight in the world,&rdquo; cried
a nun who dwelt in a hermitage close by; and she said it
in a loud voice, so that Lancelot and Percivale might hear.
But Sir Galahad feared that she would make known who
he was, so he spurred his horse and struck deep into the
forest before Sir Lancelot and Sir Percivale could mount
again. They knew not which path he had taken, so Sir
Percivale turned back to ask advice of the nun, and Sir
Lancelot pressed forward.</p>
<h3 title="">IV.
<br />How Sir Lancelot saw a Vision, and repented of his Sins.</h3>
<p>He halted when he came to a stone cross, which had by it
a block of marble, while nigh at hand stood an old chapel.
He tied his horse to a tree, and hung his shield on a
branch, and looked into the chapel, for the door was waste
and broken. And he saw there a fair altar covered with
a silken cloth, and a candlestick which had six branches,
all of shining silver. A great light streamed from it, and
at this sight Sir Lancelot would fain have entered in, but
he could not. So he turned back sorrowful and dismayed,
and took the saddle and bridle off his horse, and let him
pasture where he would, while he himself unlaced his helm,
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
and ungirded his sword, and lay down to sleep upon his
shield, at the foot of the cross.</p>
<p>As he lay there, half waking and half sleeping, he saw
two white <a id="er_38" href="#ed_38">palfreys</a> come by, drawing a litter, wherein lay
a sick Knight. When they reached the cross they paused,
and Sir Lancelot heard the Knight say, &ldquo;O sweet Lord,
when shall this sorrow leave me, and when shall the Holy
Vessel come by me through which I shall be blessed?
For I have endured long, though my ill deeds were few.&rdquo;
Thus he spoke, and Sir Lancelot heard it, and of a sudden
the great candlestick stood before the cross, though no
man had brought it. And with it was a table of silver
and the Holy Vessel of the Graal, which Lancelot had
seen aforetime. Then the Knight rose up, and on his
hands and knees he approached the Holy Vessel, and
prayed, and was made whole of his sickness. After
that the Graal went back into the chapel, and the
light and the candlestick also, and Sir Lancelot would
fain have followed, but could not, so heavy was the
weight of his sins upon him. And the sick Knight
arose and kissed the cross, and saw Sir Lancelot lying
at the foot with his eyes shut. &ldquo;I marvel greatly at this
sleeping Knight,&rdquo; he said to his squire, &ldquo;that he had no
power to wake when the Holy Vessel was brought hither.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I dare right well say,&rdquo; answered the squire, &ldquo;that he
dwelleth in some deadly sin, whereof he was never confessed.&rdquo;
&ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;he is unhappy,
whoever he is, for he is of the fellowship of the Round
Table, which have undertaken the quest of the Graal.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the squire, &ldquo;you have all your arms here,
save only your sword and your <a id="er_39" href="#ed_39">helm</a>. Take therefore
those of this strange Knight, who has just put them
off.&rdquo; And the Knight did as his squire said, and took
Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s horse also, for it was better than his own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>After they had gone Sir Lancelot waked up wholly,
and thought of what he had seen, wondering if he were
in a dream or not. Suddenly a voice spoke to him and
it said, &ldquo;Sir Lancelot, more hard than is the stone, more
bitter than is the wood, more naked and barren than is
the leaf of the fig tree, art thou; therefore go from hence
and withdraw thee from this holy place.&rdquo; When Sir
Lancelot heard this, his heart was passing heavy, and he
wept, cursing the day when he had been born. But his
helm and sword had gone from the spot where he had
laid them at the foot of the cross, and his horse was gone
also. And he smote himself and cried, &ldquo;My sin and my
wickedness have done me this dishonour; for when I
sought worldly adventures I ever achieved them and had
the better in every place, and never was I <a id="er_40" href="#ed_40">discomfited</a> in
any quarrel, were it right or wrong. But now I take upon
me the adventures of holy things, I see and understand
that my old sin hinders me, so that I could not move or
speak when the Holy Graal passed by.&rdquo; Thus he sorrowed
till it was day, and he heard the birds sing, and at that
he felt comforted. And as his horse was gone also, he
departed on foot with a heavy heart.</p>
<h3 title="">V.
<br />The Adventure of Sir Percivale.</h3>
<p>All this while Sir Percivale had pursued adventures of his
own, and came nigh unto losing his life, but he was saved
from his enemies by the good Knight, Sir Galahad, whom
he did not know, although he was seeking him, for Sir
Galahad now bore a red shield, and not a white one. And
at last the foes fled deep into the forest, and Sir Galahad
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
followed; but Sir Percivale had no horse and was forced to
stay behind. Then his eyes were opened, and he knew it
was Sir Galahad who had come to his help, and he sat down
under a tree and grieved sore.</p>
<p>While he was sitting there a Knight passed by riding
a black horse, and when he was out of sight a yeoman came
pricking after as fast as he could, and, seeing Sir Percivale,
asked if he had seen a Knight mounted on a black horse.
&ldquo;Yes, Sir, forsooth,&rdquo; answered Sir Percivale, &ldquo;why do you
want to know?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, Sir, that is my steed which he
has taken from me, and wherever my lord shall find me,
he is sure to slay me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sir Percivale, &ldquo;thou
seest that I am on foot, but had I a good horse I would
soon come up with him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Take my hackney,&rdquo; said the
yeoman, &ldquo;and do the best you can, and I shall follow you
on foot to watch how you speed.&rdquo; So Sir Percivale rode
as fast as he might, and at last he saw that Knight, and
he hailed him. The Knight turned and set his spear
against Sir Percivale, and smote the hackney in the breast,
so that he fell dead to the earth, and Sir Percivale fell
with him; then the Knight rode away. But Sir Percivale
was mad with wrath, and cried to the Knight to return and
fight with him on foot; but the Knight answered not and
went on his way. When Sir Percivale saw that he would
not turn, he threw himself on the ground, and cast away
his helm and sword, and bemoaned himself for the most
unhappy of all Knights; and there he abode the whole
day, and, being faint and weary, slept till it was midnight.
At midnight he waked and saw before him a woman,
who said to him right fiercely, &ldquo;Sir Percivale, what doest
thou here?&rdquo; &ldquo;Neither good nor great ill,&rdquo; answered he.
&ldquo;If thou wilt promise to do my will when I call upon
thee,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I will lend thee my own horse, and he
shall bear thee whither thou shalt choose.&rdquo; This Sir
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
Percivale promised gladly, and the woman went and returned
with a black horse, so large and well-apparelled
that Sir Percivale marvelled. But he mounted him gladly,
and drove in his spurs, and within an hour and less the
horse bare him four days&rsquo; journey thence, and would have
borne him into a rough water, had not Sir Percivale
pulled at his bridle. The Knight stood doubting, for the
water made a great noise, and he feared lest his horse
could not get through it. Still, wishing greatly to pass
over, he made himself ready, and signed the sign of the
cross upon his forehead.</p>
<p>At that the fiend which had taken the shape of a horse
shook off Sir Percivale and dashed into the water, crying
and making great sorrow; and it seemed to him that the
water burned. Then Sir Percivale knew that it was not a
horse but a fiend which would have brought him to perdition,
and he gave thanks and prayed all that night long.
As soon as it was day he looked about him, and saw he was
in a wild mountain, girt round with the sea and filled with
wild beasts. Then he rose and went into a valley, and there
he saw a young serpent bring a young lion by the neck,
and after that there passed a great lion, crying and roaring
after the serpent, and a fierce battle began between them.
Sir Percivale thought to help the lion, as he was the more
natural beast of the twain, and he drew his sword and set
his shield before him, and gave the serpent a deadly buffet.
When the lion saw that, he made him all the cheer that a
beast might make a man, and fawned about him like a
spaniel, and stroked him with his paws. And about noon
the lion took his little whelp, and placed him on his back,
and bare him home again, and Sir Percivale, being left
alone, prayed till he was comforted. But at eventide the
lion returned, and couched down at his feet, and all night
long he and the lion slept together.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h3 title="">VI.
<br />An Adventure of Sir Lancelot.</h3>
<p>As Lancelot went his way through the forest he met with
many hermits who dwelled therein, and had adventure
with the Knight who stole his horse and his helm, and got
them back again. And he learned from one of the hermits
that Sir Galahad was his son, and that it was he who at
the Feast of Pentecost had sat in the Siege Perilous, which
it was ordained by Merlin that none should sit in save the
best Knight in the world. All that night Sir Lancelot abode
with the hermit and laid him to rest, a <a id="er_41" href="#ed_41">hair shirt</a> always on
his body, and it pricked him sorely, but he bore it meekly
and suffered the pain. When the day dawned he bade the
hermit farewell. As he rode he came to a fair plain, in which
was a great castle set about with tents and pavilions of
divers hues. Here were full five hundred Knights riding on
horseback, and those near the castle were mounted on
black horses with black trappings, and they that were without
were on white horses and their trappings white. And
the two sides fought together, and Sir Lancelot looked on.</p>
<p>At last it seemed to him that the black Knights
nearest the castle fared the worst, so, as he ever took the
part of the weaker, he rode to their help and smote many
of the white Knights to the earth and did marvellous
deeds of arms. But always the white Knights held round
Sir Lancelot to tire him out. And as no man may endure
for ever, in the end Sir Lancelot waxed so faint of fighting
that his arms would not lift themselves to deal a stroke;
then they took him, and led him away into the forest and
made him alight from his horse and rest, and when he
was taken the fellowship of the castle were overcome for
want of him. &ldquo;Never ere now was I at tournament or
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
jousts but I had the best,&rdquo; moaned Sir Lancelot to himself,
as soon as the Knights had left him and he was alone.
&ldquo;But now am I shamed, and I am persuaded that I am
more sinful than ever I was.&rdquo; Sorrowfully he rode on
till he passed a chapel, where stood a nun, who called to
him and asked him his name and what he was seeking.</p>
<p>So he told her who he was, and what had befallen him
at the tournament, and the vision that had come to him
in his sleep. &ldquo;Ah, Lancelot,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;as long as you
were a knight of earthly knighthood you were the most
wonderful man in the world and the most adventurous.
But now, since you are set among Knights of heavenly
adventures, if you were worsted at that tournament it is
no marvel. For the tournament was meant for a sign,
and the earthly Knights were they who were clothed in
black in token of the sins of which they were not yet
<a id="er_42" href="#ed_42">purged</a>. And the white Knights were they who had
chosen the way of holiness, and in them the quest has
already begun. Thus you beheld both the sinners and
the good men, and when you saw the sinners overcome you
went to their help, as they were your fellows in boasting
and pride of the world, and all that must be left in that
quest. And that caused your misadventure. Now that
I have warned you of your vain-glory and your pride,
beware of everlasting pain, for of all earthly Knights I
have pity of you, for I know well that among earthly
sinful Knights you are without <a id="er_43" href="#ed_43">peer</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 title="">VII.
<br />An Adventure of Sir Gawaine.</h3>
<p>When Sir Gawaine departed he rode long without any
adventure. From Whitsunday to Michaelmas he rode and
found not the tenth part of the adventures he was wont to
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
do. But it befell on a day that he met <a id="er_44" href="#ed_44">Sir Ector de Maris</a>,
at which they rejoiced exceedingly, complaining to one
another of the lack of adventure in the quest on which
they were set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Sir Gawaine to Sir Ector, &ldquo;I am nigh
weary of this quest, and loth to follow it to further strange
countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing seems strange to me,&rdquo; said Sir Ector, &ldquo;I
have met with twenty Knights, and they all complain as
I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;where your brother
is.&rdquo; &ldquo;I can hear nothing of him,&rdquo; answered Sir Ector, &ldquo;nor
of Sir Galahad, <a id="er_45" href="#ed_45">Sir Percivale</a>, or Sir Bors, but they fare
well, no doubt, for they have no peers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they sat talking there appeared before them a hand
showing unto the elbow covered with red samite, and
holding a great candle that burned right clear; and the
hand passed into the chapel and vanished, they knew not
where. Then they heard a voice which said, &ldquo;Knights
full of evil faith and poor belief, these two things have
failed you, and therefore you may not come to the
adventure of the Holy Graal.&rdquo; And thereat they went
to a holy man to whom they confessed their sins. Said
he, &ldquo;This is the meaning of the vision: you have failed in
three things, charity, fasting, and truth, and have been
great murderers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Gawaine, &ldquo;by your words it seems that
our sins will not let us labour in that quest?&rdquo; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo;
answered the hermit, &ldquo;there be an hundred such as you
to whom it will bring naught but shame.&rdquo; So Gawaine
departed and followed Sir Ector, who had ridden on
before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h3 title="">VIII.
<br />The Adventure of Sir Bors.</h3>
<p>When Sir Bors left Camelot on his quest he met a holy
man riding on an ass, and Sir Bors saluted him. Anon
the good man knew him to be one of the Knights who
were in quest of the Holy Graal. &ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; said
he, and Sir Bors answered, &ldquo;I am a Knight that fain
would be counselled in the quest of the Graal, for he shall
have much earthly worship that brings it to an end.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the good man, &ldquo;for he will be the best
Knight in the world, but know well that there shall none
attain it but by holiness and by confession of sin.&rdquo; So
they rode together till they came to the hermitage, and the
good man led Sir Bors into the chapel, where he made
confession of his sins, and they ate bread and drank water
together. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;I pray you that you
eat none other till you sit at the table where the Holy
Graal shall be.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Sir Bors, &ldquo;I agree
thereto, but how know you that I shall sit there?&rdquo; &ldquo;That
know I,&rdquo; said the holy man, &ldquo;but there will be but few
of your fellows with you. Also instead of a shirt you shall
wear this garment until you have achieved your quest,&rdquo;
and Sir Bors took off his clothes, and put on instead a
scarlet coat. Then the good man questioned him, and
marvelled to find him pure in life, and he armed him and
bade him go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<div class="img" id="picb2">
<img src="images/illus_076.jpg" alt="HOW SIR BORS WAS SAVED FROM KILLING HIS BROTHER" width="427" height="481" />
</div>
<p>After this Sir Bors rode through many
lands, and had many adventures, and was often sore
tempted, but remembered the words of the holy man and
kept his life clean of wrong. And once he had by mischance
almost slain his own brother, but a voice cried,
&ldquo;Flee, Bors, and touch him not,&rdquo; and he hearkened and
stayed his hand. And there fell between them a fiery
cloud, which burned up both their shields, and they two
fell to the earth in a great swoon; but when they awakened
out of it Bors saw that his brother had no harm. With
that the voice spoke to him saying, &ldquo;Bors, go hence and
bear your brother fellowship no longer; but take your
way to the sea, where Sir Percivale abides till you come.&rdquo;
Then Sir Bors prayed his brother to forgive him all he
had unknowingly done, and rode straight to the sea. On
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
the shore he found a vessel covered with white samite,
and as soon as he stepped in the vessel it set sail so fast
it might have been flying, and Sir Bors lay down and
slept till it was day. When he waked he saw a Knight
lying in the midst of the ship, all armed save for his helm,
and he knew him for Sir Percivale, and welcomed him
with great joy; and they told each other of their adventures
and of their temptations, and had great happiness in each
other&rsquo;s company. &ldquo;We lack nothing but Galahad, the
good Knight,&rdquo; Sir Percivale said.</p>
<h3 title="">IX.
<br />Adventure of Sir Galahad.</h3>
<p>Sir Galahad rested one evening at a hermitage. And
while he was resting, there came a gentlewoman and asked
leave of the hermit to speak with Sir Galahad, and would
not be denied, though she was told he was weary and
asleep. Then the hermit waked Sir Galahad and bade
him rise, as a gentlewoman had great need of him, so Sir
Galahad rose and asked her what she wished. &ldquo;Galahad,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;I will that you arm yourself, and mount your
horse and follow me, and I will show you the highest
adventure that ever any Knight saw.&rdquo; And Sir Galahad
bade her go, and he would follow wherever she led. In
three days they reached the sea, where they found the
ship where Sir Bors and Sir Percivale were lying. And
the lady bade him leave his horse behind and said she
would leave hers also, but their saddles and bridles they
would take on board the ship. This they did, and were
received with great joy by the two Knights; then the sails
were spread, and the ship was driven before the wind at a
marvellous pace till they reached the land of Logris, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
entrance to which lies between two great rocks with a
whirlpool in the middle.</p>
<p>Their own ship might not get safely through; but they
left it and went into another ship that lay there, which
had neither man nor woman in it. At the end of the ship
was written these words: &ldquo;Thou man which shalt enter
this ship beware thou be in steadfast belief; if thou fail,
I shall not help thee.&rdquo; Then the gentlewoman turned and
said, &ldquo;Percivale, do you know who I am?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, truly,&rdquo;
answered he. &ldquo;I am your sister, and therefore you are
the man in the world that I most love. If you are without
faith, or have any hidden sin, beware how you enter,
else you will perish.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fair sister,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;I
shall enter therein, for if I am an untrue Knight then
shall I perish.&rdquo; So they entered the ship, and it was so
rich and well adorned, that they all marvelled.</p>
<p>In the midst of it was a fair bed, and Sir Galahad
went thereto and found on it a crown of silk, and a sword
drawn out of its sheath half a foot and more. The sword was
of divers fashions, and the pommel was of stone, wrought
about with colours, and every colour with its own virtue,
and the handle was of the ribs of two beasts. The one was
the bone of a serpent, and no hand that handles it shall
ever become weary or hurt; and the other was a bone of a
fish that swims in Euphrates, and whoso handles it shall
not think on joy or sorrow that he has had, but only on
that which he beholds before him. And no man shall grip
this sword but one that is better than other men. So first
Sir Percivale stepped forward and set his hand to the sword,
but he might not grasp it. Next Sir Bors tried to seize it,
but he also failed. When Sir Galahad beheld the sword,
he saw that there was written on it, in letters of blood,
that he who tried to draw it should never fail of shame in
his body or be wounded to the death. &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
said Galahad, &ldquo;I would draw this sword out of its sheath,
but the offending is so great I shall not lay my hand
thereto.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered the gentlewoman, &ldquo;know that
no man can draw this sword save you alone;&rdquo; and she told
him many tales of the Knights who had set their hands to
it, and of the evil things that had befallen them. And
they all begged Sir Galahad to grip the sword, as it was
ordained that he should. &ldquo;I will grip it,&rdquo; said Galahad,
&ldquo;to give you courage, but it belongs no more to me than
it does to you.&rdquo; Then he gripped it tight with his fingers,
and the gentlewoman girt him about the middle with the
sword, and after that they left that ship and went into
another, which brought them to land, where they fell
upon many strange adventures. On the shore they saw
three score Knights by a castle to which they repaired.
And the owner of this castle was a gentlewoman on whom
years ago had befallen a great malady of which there was
but one remedy. It was that she must be anointed with
a dish of the blood of a maid pure and fair, and a King&rsquo;s
daughter withal.</p>
<p>And the Knights accosted them, and counselled them
to withdraw, saying they might go without harm, only
they must needs have their custom. And this custom was
the blood of Sir Percivale&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>And Sir Galahad drew his sword with the two handles,
and slew whatever withstood him. But night fell, and a
good Knight promised to harbour them for the night safely
and surely, saying, &ldquo;On the morrow we dare say you will
accord with the custom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Sir Percivale&rsquo;s sister, &ldquo;fair Knights, I
fain would heal this fair lady, for thus shall I gain great
worship and my lineage withal, and better is one harm
than twain. And therefore there shall be no battle, but
to-morrow at morn I shall yield you your custom of this
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
castle.&rdquo; And then there was great joy. It chanced
that while she bled on the morrow, she lifted her hands
and blessed them, and she said, &ldquo;Madam, I die to make
you whole, for God&rsquo;s love pray for me.&rdquo; With that she
fell in a swoon. Then Galahad and his fellows lifted her
up and stanched her, but she died, and weeping, they put
her body in a barge as she had wished. In her hand Sir
Percivale put a letter showing how she had helped them,
and they covered her with black silk; so the wind arose
and drove the barge from the land, and all Knights beheld
it disappear from sight.</p>
<h3 title="">X.
<br />Sir Lancelot meets Sir Galahad, and they part for Ever.</h3>
<p>Now we must tell what happened to Sir Lancelot.</p>
<p>When he was come to a water called Mortoise he fell
asleep, awaiting for the adventure that should be sent to
him, and in his sleep a voice spoke to him, and bade him
rise and take his armour, and enter the first ship he
should find. So he started up and took his arms and
made him ready, and on the strand he found a ship that
was without sail or oar. As soon as he was within the
ship, he felt himself wrapped round with a sweetness
such as he had never known before, as if all that he
could desire was fulfilled. And with this joy and peace
about him he fell asleep. When he woke he found near
him a fair bed, with a dead lady lying on it, whom he
knew to be Sir Percivale&rsquo;s sister, and in her hand was the
tale of her adventures, which Sir Lancelot took and read.
For a month or more they dwelt in that ship together,
and one day, when it had drifted near the shore, he heard
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
a sound as of a horse; and when the steps came nearer
he saw that a Knight was riding him. At the sight of
the ship the Knight alighted and took the saddle and
bridle, and entered the ship. &ldquo;You are welcome,&rdquo; said
Lancelot, and the Knight saluted him and said, &ldquo;What is
your name? for my heart goeth out to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;my name is Sir Lancelot du
Lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the new Knight, &ldquo;you are welcome, for you
are my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;is it you, then, Galahad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in sooth,&rdquo; said he, and kneeled down and asked
Lancelot&rsquo;s blessing, and then took off his helm and kissed
him. And there was great joy between them, and they
told each other all that had befallen them since they left
King Arthur&rsquo;s Court. Then Galahad saw the gentlewoman
dead on the bed, and he knew her, and said he held her
in great worship, and that she was the best maid in the
world, and how it was great pity that she had come to
her death. But when Lancelot heard that Galahad had
won the marvellous sword he prayed that he might see
it, and kissed the pommel and the hilt, and the scabbard.
&ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;never did I know of adventures
so wonderful and strange.&rdquo; So dwelled Lancelot and
Galahad in that ship for half a year, and served God
daily and nightly with all their power. And after six
months had gone it befell that on a Monday they drifted
to the edge of the forest, where they saw a Knight with
white armour bestriding one horse and holding another all
white, by the bridle. And he came to the ship, and
saluted the two Knights and said, &ldquo;Galahad, you have
been long enough with your father, therefore leave that
ship and start upon this horse, and go on the quest of
the Holy Graal.&rdquo; So Galahad went to his father and
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
kissed him, saying, &ldquo;Fair sweet father, I know not if I
shall see you more till I have beheld the Holy Graal.&rdquo;
Then they heard a voice which said, &ldquo;The one shall never
see the other till the day of doom.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now, Galahad,&rdquo;
said Lancelot, &ldquo;since we are to bid farewell for ever now,
I pray to the great Father to preserve you and me both.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Galahad, &ldquo;no prayer availeth so much as
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Sir Lancelot made his way back to
Camelot, where he found King Arthur and Guenevere;
but many of the Knights of the Round Table were slain
and destroyed, more than the half. All the Court was
passing glad to see Sir Lancelot, and the King asked many
tidings of his son Sir Galahad.</p>
<h3 title="">XI.
<br />How Sir Galahad found the Graal and died of that Finding.</h3>
<p>Sir Galahad rode on till he met Sir Percivale and afterwards
Sir Bors, whom they greeted most gladly, and they
bare each other company. First they came to the Castle
of Carbonek, where dwelled <a id="er_46" href="#ed_46">King Pelles</a>, who welcomed
them with joy, for he knew by their coming the quest of
the Graal would be fulfilled. They then departed on other
adventures, and it is told how Galahad cured the maimed
King by anointing him with blood from a certain holy
spear. That same night at midnight a voice bade them
arise and quit the castle, which they did, followed by
three Knights of Gaul. Then Galahad prayed every one
of them that if they reached King Arthur&rsquo;s Court they
should salute Sir Lancelot his father, and those Knights of
the Round Table that were present, and with that he left
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
them, and Sir Bors and Sir Percivale with him. For
three days they rode till they came to a shore, and found
a ship awaiting them. And in the midst of it was the
table of silver, and the Holy Graal which was covered
with red samite. Then were their hearts right glad, and
they made great reverence thereto, and Galahad prayed
that at what time he asked, he might depart out of this
world. So long he prayed that at length a voice said to
him, &ldquo;Galahad, thou shalt have thy desire, and when thou
askest the death of the body thou shalt have it, and shalt
find the life of the soul.&rdquo; Percivale likewise heard the
voice, and besought Galahad to tell him why he asked
such things. And Galahad answered, &ldquo;The other day
when we saw a part of the adventures of the Holy Graal,
I was in such a joy of heart that never did man feel before,
and I knew well that when my body is dead my soul
shall be in joy of which the other was but a shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some time were the three Knights in that ship, till at
length they saw before them the city of Sarras. Then
they took from the ship the table of silver, and Sir Percivale
and Sir Bors went first, and Sir Galahad followed
after to the gate of the city, where sat an old man that
was crooked. At the sight of the old man Sir Galahad
called to him to help them carry the table, for it was
heavy. &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; answered the old man, &ldquo;it is ten years
since I have gone without crutches.&rdquo; &ldquo;Care not for that,&rdquo;
said Galahad, &ldquo;but rise up and show your good will.&rdquo; So
he arose and found himself as whole as ever he was, and
he ran to the table and held up the side next Galahad.
And there was much noise in the city that a cripple was
healed by three Knights newly entered in. This reached
the ears of the King, who sent for the Knights and questioned
them. And they told him the truth, and of the
Holy Graal; but the King listened nothing to all they
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
said, but put them into a deep hole in the prison. Even
here they were not without comfort, for a vision of the
Holy Graal sustained them. And at the end of a year
the King lay sick and felt he should die, and he called
the three Knights and asked forgiveness of the evil he had
done to them, which they gave gladly. Then he died, and
the whole city was afraid and knew not what to do, till
while they were in counsel a voice came to them and bade
them choose the youngest of the three strange Knights for
their King. And they did so. After Galahad was proclaimed
King, he ordered that a coffer of gold and precious
stones should be made to encompass the table of silver,
and every day he and the two Knights would kneel before
it and make their prayers.</p>
<p>Now at the year&rsquo;s end, and on the selfsame day that
Galahad had been crowned King, he arose up early and
came with the two Knights to the Palace; and he saw a
man in the likeness of a Bishop, encircled by a great
crowd of angels, kneeling before the Holy Vessel. And
he called to Galahad and said to him, &ldquo;Come forth, thou
servant of Christ, and thou shalt see what thou hast much
desired to see.&rdquo; Then Galahad began to tremble right
hard, when the flesh first beheld the things of the spirit,
and he held up his hand to heaven and said, &ldquo;Lord, I
thank thee, for now I see that which hath been my desire
for many a day. Now, blessed Lord, I would no longer
live, if it might please Thee.&rdquo; Then Galahad went to
Percivale and kissed him, and commended him to God;
and he went to Sir Bors and kissed him, and commended
him to God, and said, &ldquo;Fair lord, salute me to my lord
Sir Lancelot, my father, and bid him remember this unstable
world.&rdquo; Therewith he kneeled down before the
table and made his prayers, and while he was praying
his soul suddenly left the body and was carried by angels
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
up into heaven, which the two Knights right well beheld.
Also they saw come from heaven a hand, but no body
behind it, and it came unto the Vessel, and took it and the
spear, and bare them back to heaven. And since then
no man has dared to say that he has seen the Holy Graal.</p>
<p>When Percivale and Bors saw Galahad lying dead
they made as much sorrow as ever two men did, and the
people of the country and of the city were right heavy.
And they buried him as befitted their King. As soon as
Galahad was buried, Sir Percivale sought a hermitage
outside the city, and put on the dress of a hermit, and
Sir Bors was always with him, but kept the dress that he
wore at Court. When a year and two months had passed
Sir Percivale died also, and was buried by the side of
Galahad; and Sir Bors left that land, and after long
riding came to Camelot. Then was there great joy made
of him in the Court, for they had held him as dead; and
the King ordered great clerks to attend him, and to write
down all his adventures and those of Sir Percivale and Sir
Galahad. Next, Sir Lancelot told the adventures of the
Graal which he had seen, and this likewise was written
and placed with the other in <a id="er_47" href="#ed_47">almonries</a> at Salisbury.
And by-and-by Sir Bors said to Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;Galahad
your son saluteth you by me, and after you King Arthur
and all the Court, and so did Sir Percivale; for I buried
them with mine own hands in the City of Sarras. Also,
Sir Lancelot, Galahad prayeth you to remember of this
uncertain world, as you promised when you were together!&rdquo;
&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;and I trust
his prayer may avail me.&rdquo; But the prayer but little
availed Sir Lancelot, for he fell to his old sins again.
And now the Knights were few that survived the search
for the Graal, and the evil days of Arthur began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />PART III.
<br />THE FIGHT FOR THE QUEEN.</h2>
<p>So the quest of the Holy Graal had been fulfilled, and the
few Knights that had been left alive returned to the
Round Table, and there was great joy in the Court. To
do them honour the Queen made them a dinner; and
there were four and twenty Knights present, and among
them Sir Patrise of Ireland, and Sir Gawaine and his
brethren, the King&rsquo;s nephews, which were Sir Agrawaine,
Sir Gaheris, Sir Gareth, and Sir Mordred. Now it was
the custom of Sir Gawaine daily at dinner and supper to
eat all manner of fruit, and especially pears and apples,
and this the Queen knew, and set fruit of all sorts before
him. And there was present at the dinner one Sir Pinel
le Savage, who hated Sir Gawaine because he and his
brethren had slain Sir Lamorak du Galis, cousin to Sir
Pinel; so he put poison into some of the apples, hoping
that Sir Gawaine would eat one and die. But by ill
fortune it befell that the good Knight Sir Patrise took
a poisoned apple, and in a few moments he lay dead
and stark in his seat. At this sight all the Knights leapt
to their feet, but said nothing, for they bethought them
that Queen Guenevere had made them the dinner, and
feared that she had poisoned the fruit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lady, the Queen,&rdquo; said Sir Gawaine, who was the
first to speak, &ldquo;this fruit was brought for me, for all know
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
how well I love it; therefore, Madam, the shame of this
ill deed is yours.&rdquo; The Queen stood still, pale and
trembling, but kept silence, and next spoke Sir Mador
de la Porte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This shall not be ended so,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for I have lost
a noble Knight of my blood, and I will be avenged of the
person who has wrought this evil.&rdquo; And he turned to
the Queen and said &ldquo;Madam, it is you who have brought
about the death of my cousin Sir Patrise!&rdquo; The Knights
round listened in silence, for they too thought Sir Mador
spake truth. And the Queen still said nothing, but fell
to weeping bitterly, till King Arthur heard and came to
look into the matter. And when they told him of their
trouble his heart was heavy within him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair lords,&rdquo; said the King at last, &ldquo;I grieve for this
ill deed; but I cannot meddle therein, or do battle for my
wife, for I have to judge justly. Sure I am that this deed
is none of hers, therefore many a good Knight will stand
her champion that she be not burned to death in a wrong
quarrel. And Sir Mador, hold not your head so high, but
fix the day of battle, when you shall find a Knight to
answer you, or else it were great shame to all my Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious lord,&rdquo; said Sir Mador, &ldquo;you must hold
me excused. But though you are a King you are also a
Knight, and must obey the laws of Knighthood. Therefore
I beseech your forgiveness if I declare that none of
the four and twenty Knights here present will fight that
battle. What say you, my lords?&rdquo; Then the Knights
answered that they could not hold the Queen guiltless, for
as the dinner was made by her either she or her servants
must have done this thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;no evil was in my heart
when I prepared this feast, for never have I done such
foul deeds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;My lord the King,&rdquo; cried Sir Mador, &ldquo;I require of
you, as you are a just King, to fix a day that I may get
ready for the fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered the King, &ldquo;on the fifteenth day from
this come on horseback to the meadow that is by Westminster.
And if it happens that there be a Knight to
fight with you, strike as hard as you will, God will speed
the right. But if no Knight is there, then must my
Queen be burned, and a fire shall be made in the meadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am answered,&rdquo; said Sir Mador, and he and the rest
of the Knights departed.</p>
<p>When the King and Queen were left alone he asked
her what had brought all this about. &ldquo;God help me, that
I know not,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;nor how it was done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Sir Lancelot?&rdquo; said King Arthur, looking
round. &ldquo;If he were here he would not grudge to do battle
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the Queen, &ldquo;I know not where he is, but
his brother and his kinsmen think he is not in this
realm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grieve for that,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;for he would soon
stop this strife. But I counsel you, ask Sir Bors, and he
will not refuse you. For well I see that none of the four
and twenty Knights who were with you at dinner will be
your champion, and none will say well of you, but men
will speak evil of you at the Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; sighed the Queen, &ldquo;I do indeed miss Sir
Lancelot, for he would soon ease my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you?&rdquo; asked the King, &ldquo;that you cannot
keep Sir Lancelot at your side, for well you know that he
who Sir Lancelot fights for has the best Knight in the
world for his champion. Now go your way, and command
Sir Bors to do battle with you for Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
So the Queen departed from the King, and sent for Sir
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
Bors into her chamber, and when he came she besought
his help.</p>
<div class="img" id="picb3">
<img src="images/illus_089.jpg" alt="SIR MADOR ACCUSES GUENEVERE" width="405" height="497" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what can I do? for I may not
meddle in this matter lest the Knights who were at the
dinner have me in suspicion, for I was there also. It is
now, Madam, that you miss Sir Lancelot, whom you have
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
driven away, as he would have done battle for you were
you right or wrong, and I wonder how for shame&rsquo;s sake
you can ask me, knowing how I love and honour him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;I throw myself on your
grace,&rdquo; and she went down on her knees and besought Sir
Bors to have mercy on her, &ldquo;else I shall have a shameful
death, and one I have never deserved.&rdquo; At that King
Arthur came in, and found her kneeling before Sir Bors.
&ldquo;Madame! you do me great dishonour,&rdquo; said Sir Bors,
raising her up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, gentle Knight,&rdquo; cried the King, &ldquo;have mercy on
my Queen, for I am sure that they speak falsely. And I
require by the love of Sir Lancelot that you do battle for
her instead of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; answered Sir Bors, &ldquo;you require of me the
hardest thing that ever any one asked of me, for well you
know that if I fight for the Queen I shall anger all my
companions of the Round Table; but I will not say nay,
my lord, for Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s sake and for your own sake!
On that day I will be the Queen&rsquo;s champion, unless a
better Knight is found to do battle for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you promise me this?&rdquo; asked the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Sir Bors, &ldquo;I will not fail you nor her,
unless there should come a better Knight than I, then he
shall have the battle.&rdquo; Then the King and Queen rejoiced
greatly, and thanked Sir Bors with all their hearts.</p>
<p>So Sir Bors departed and rode unto Sir Lancelot, who
was with the hermit Sir Brasias, and told him of this
adventure. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;this has befallen as
I would have it, and therefore I pray you make ready to
do battle, but delay the fight as long as you can that I
may appear. For I am sure that Sir Mador is a hot
Knight, and the longer he waits the more impatient he
will be for the combat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Sir Bors, &ldquo;let me deal with him.
Doubt not you shall have all your will.&rdquo; And he rode
away, and came again to the Court.</p>
<p>It was soon noised about that Sir Bors would be the
Queen&rsquo;s champion, and many Knights were displeased
with him; but there were a few who held the Queen to
be innocent. Sir Bors spoke unto them all and said, &ldquo;It
were shameful, my fair lords, if we suffered the most noble
Queen in the world to be disgraced openly, not only for
her sake, but for the King&rsquo;s.&rdquo; But they answered him:
&ldquo;As for our lord King Arthur, we love him and honour him
as much as you; but as for Queen Guenevere, we love her
not, for she is the destroyer of good Knights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair lords,&rdquo; said Sir Bors, &ldquo;you shall not speak such
words, for never yet have I heard that she was the
destroyer of good Knights. But at all times, as far as I
ever knew, she maintained them and gave them many
gifts. And therefore it were a shame to us all if we suffered
our noble King&rsquo;s wife to be put to death, and I will not
suffer it. So much I will say, that the Queen is not
guilty of Sir Patrise&rsquo;s death; for she owed him no ill will,
and bade him and us to the dinner for no evil purpose,
which will be proved hereafter. And in any case there
was foul dealing among us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may believe your words,&rdquo; said some of the
Knights, but others held that he spoke falsely.</p>
<p>The days passed quickly by until the evening before
the battle, when the Queen sent for Sir Bors and asked
him if he was ready to keep his promise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, Madam,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;I shall not fail you,
unless a better Knight than I am come to do battle for you.
Then, Madam, I am discharged of my promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell this to my lord Arthur?&rdquo; said the Queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it pleases you, Madam,&rdquo; answered Sir Bors. So
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
the Queen went to the King, and told him what Sir Bors
had said, and the King bade her to be comforted, as
Sir Bors was one of the best Knights of the Round
Table.</p>
<p>The next morning the King and Queen, and all
manner of Knights, rode into the meadow of Westminster,
where the battle was to be; and the Queen was
put into the charge of the High Constable, and a stout
iron stake was planted, and a great fire made about it, at
which the Queen should be burned if Sir Mador de la
Porte won the fight. For it was the custom in those days
that neither fear nor favour, love nor kinship, should
hinder right judgment. Then came Sir Mador de la
Porte, and made oath before the King that the Queen
had done to death his cousin Sir Patrise and he would
prove it on her Knight&rsquo;s body, let who would say the
contrary. Sir Bors likewise made answer that Queen
Guenevere had done no wrong, and that he would make
good with his two hands. &ldquo;Then get you ready,&rdquo; said
Sir Mador. &ldquo;Sir Mador,&rdquo; answered Sir Bors, &ldquo;I know
you for a good Knight, but I trust to be able to withstand
your malice; and I have promised King Arthur
and my Lady the Queen that I will do battle for her to
the uttermost, unless there come forth a better Knight
than I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Sir Mador; &ldquo;but you must either
fight now or own that you are beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your horse,&rdquo; said Sir Bors, &ldquo;for I shall not tarry
long,&rdquo; and Sir Mador forthwith rode into the field with
his shield on his shoulder, and his spear in his hand, and
he went up and down crying unto King Arthur,
&ldquo;Bid your champion come forth if he dare.&rdquo; At that Sir
Bors was ashamed, and took his horse, and rode to the end
of the lists. But from a wood hard by appeared a Knight
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
riding fast on a white horse, bearing a shield full of strange
devices. When he reached Sir Bors he drew rein and said,
&ldquo;Fair Knight, be not displeased, but this battle must be
to a better Knight than you. For I have come a great
journey to fight this fight, as I promised when I spoke
with you last, and I thank you heartily for your goodwill.&rdquo;
So Sir Bors went to King Arthur and told him that a
Knight had come who wished to do battle for the Queen.
&ldquo;What Knight is he?&rdquo; asked the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I know not,&rdquo; said Sir Bors; &ldquo;but he <a id="er_48" href="#ed_48">made a covenant</a>
with me to be here this day, and now I am
discharged,&rdquo; said Sir Bors.</p>
<p>Then the King called to that Knight and asked him
if he would fight for the Queen. &ldquo;For that purpose I
came hither,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;and therefore, Sir King, delay
me no longer, for as soon as I have ended this battle I
must go hence, as I have many matters elsewhere. And
I would have you know that it is a dishonour to all the
Knights of the Round Table to let so noble a lady and
so courteous a Queen as Queen Guenevere be shamed
amongst them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Knights who were standing round looked at each
other at these words, and wondered much what man this
was who took the battle upon him, for none knew him
save Sir Bors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Sir Mador de la Porte unto the King, &ldquo;let
me know the name of him with whom I have to do.&rdquo; But
the King answered nothing, and made a sign for the fight
to begin. They rode to the end of the lists, and <a id="er_49" href="#ed_49">couched their spears</a>
and rushed together with all their force, and
Sir Mador&rsquo;s spear broke in pieces. But the other Knight&rsquo;s
spear held firm, and he pressed on Sir Mador&rsquo;s horse till
it fell backward with a great fall. Sir Mador sprang from
his horse, and, placing his shield before him, drew his
sword, and bade his foe dismount from his horse also, and
do battle with him on foot, which the unknown Knight
did. For an hour they fought thus, as Sir Mador was a
strong man, and had proved himself the victor in many
combats. At last the Knight smote Sir Mador grovelling
to his knees, and the Knight stepped forward to have
struck him flat upon the ground. Therewith Sir Mador
suddenly rose, and smote the Knight upon the thigh, so
that the blood ran out fiercely. But when the Knight
felt himself wounded, and saw his blood, he let Sir Mador
rise to his feet, and then he gave him such a buffet on
the helm that this time Sir Mador fell his length on the
earth, and the Knight sprang to him, to unloose his
helm. At this Sir Mador prayed for his life, acknowledging
that he was overcome, and confessed that the
Queen&rsquo;s innocence had been proved. &ldquo;I will only grant
you your life,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;if you will proclaim
publicly that you have foully slandered the Queen, and
that you make no mention, on the tomb of Sir Patrise,
that ever Queen Guenevere consented to his murder.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All that will I do,&rdquo; said Sir Mador, and some Knights
took him up, and carried him away to heal his wounds.
And the other knight went straight to the foot of the
steps where sat King Arthur, and there the Queen had
just come, and the King and the Queen kissed each other
before all the people. When King Arthur saw the Knight
standing there he stooped down to him and thanked him,
and so likewise did the Queen; and they prayed him to
put off his helmet, and commanded wine to be brought,
and when he unlaced his helmet to drink they knew him
to be Sir Lancelot du Lake. Then Arthur took the
Queen&rsquo;s hand and led her to Sir Lancelot and said, &ldquo;Sir,
I give you the most heartfelt thanks of the great deed you
have done this day for me and my Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; answered Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;you know well
that I ought of right ever to fight your battles, and those
of my lady the Queen. For it was you who gave me the
high honour of Knighthood, and that same day my lady
the Queen did me a great service, else I should have been
put to shame before all men. Because in my hastiness I
lost my sword, and my lady the Queen found it and gave
it to me when I had sore need of it. And therefore, my
lord Arthur, I promised her that day that I would be her
Knight in right or in wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe you great thanks,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;and some
time I hope to repay you.&rdquo; The Queen, beholding Sir
Lancelot, wept tears of joy for her deliverance, and felt
bowed to the ground with sorrow at the thought of what
he had done for her, when she had sent him away with
unkind words. Then all the Knights of the Round Table
and his kinsmen drew near to him and welcomed him,
and there was great mirth in the Court.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><br />THE FAIR MAID OF ASTOLAT.</h2>
<p>Soon after this it befell that the damsel of the lake, called
by some Nimue and by others Vivien, wedded Sir Pelleas,
and came to the Court of King Arthur. And when she
heard the talk of the death of Sir Patrise and how the
Queen had been accused of it, she found out by means of
her magic that the tale was false, and told it openly that
the Queen was innocent and that it was Sir Pinel who
had poisoned the apple. Then he fled into his own
country, where none might lay hands on him. So Sir
Patrise was buried in the Church of Westminster, and on
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
his tomb was written, &ldquo;Here lieth Sir Patrise of Ireland,
slain by Sir Pinel le Savage, that empoisoned apples to
have slain Sir Gawaine, and by misfortune Sir Patrise ate
one of those apples and then suddenly he burst.&rdquo; Also
there was put upon the tomb that Queen Guenevere was
accused of the death of Sir Patrise by Sir Mador de la
Porte, and how Sir Lancelot fought with him and overcame
him in battle. All this was written on the tomb.</p>
<p>And daily Sir Mador prayed to have the Queen&rsquo;s grace
once more, and by means of Sir Lancelot he was forgiven.
It was now the middle of the summer, and King Arthur
proclaimed that in fifteen days a great tourney should be
held at <a id="er_50" href="#ed_50">Camelot</a>, which is now called Winchester, and
many Knights and Kings made ready to do themselves
honour. But the Queen said she would stay behind, for
she was sick, and did not care for the noise and hustle of
a tourney. &ldquo;It grieves me you should say that,&rdquo; said the
King, &ldquo;for you will not have seen so noble a company
gathered together this seven years past, save at the
Whitsuntide when Galahad departed from the Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; answered the Queen, &ldquo;the sight will be grand.
Nevertheless you must hold me excused, for I cannot be
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Lancelot likewise declared that his wounds were
not healed and that he could not bear himself in a tourney
as he was wont to do. At this the King was wroth, that
he might not have either his Queen or his best Knight
with him, and he departed towards Winchester and by
the way lodged in a town now called Guildford, but then
Astolat. And when the King had set forth, the Queen
sent for Sir Lancelot, and told him he was to blame for
having excused himself from going with the King, who
set such store by his company; and Sir Lancelot said he
would be ruled by her, and would ride forth next morning
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
on his way to Winchester; &ldquo;but I should have you
know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that at the tourney I shall be against
the King and his Knights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must do as you please,&rdquo; replied the Queen, &ldquo;but
if you will be ruled by my counsel, you will fight on his
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;I pray you not to be
displeased with me. I will take the adventure as it
comes,&rdquo; and early next morning he rode away till at eventide
he reached Astolat. He went through the town till
he stopped before the house of an old Baron, Sir Bernard
of Astolat, and as he dismounted from his horse, the King
spied him from the gardens of the castle. &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; he
said, smiling to the Knights that were beside him, &ldquo;I see
one man who will play his part in the <a id="er_51" href="#ed_51">jousts</a>, and I will
undertake that he will do marvels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; asked they all. &ldquo;You must wait
to know that,&rdquo; replied the King, and went into the
castle. Meantime Sir Lancelot had entered his lodging,
and the old Baron bade him welcome, but he knew not
it was Sir Lancelot. &ldquo;Fair Sir,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;I pray
you lend me, if you can, a shield with a device which no
man knows, for mine they know well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Sir Bernard, &ldquo;you shall have your
wish, for you seem one of the goodliest Knights in the
world. And, Sir, I have two sons, both but lately knighted,
Sir Tirre who was wounded on the day of his Knighthood,
and his shield you shall have. My youngest son, Sir
Lavaine, shall ride with you, if you will have his company,
to the jousts. For my heart is much drawn to you,
and tell me, I beseech you, what name I shall call you
by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must hold me excused as to that, just now,&rdquo; said
Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;but if I speed well at the jousts, I will come
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
again and tell you. But let me have Sir Lavaine with me,
and lend me, as you have offered, his brother&rsquo;s shield.&rdquo;
&ldquo;This shall be done,&rdquo; replied Sir Bernard.</p>
<p>Besides these two sons, Sir Bernard had a daughter
whom every one called The Fair Maid of Astolat, though
her real name was Elaine le Blanc. And when she looked
on Sir Lancelot, her love went forth to him and she could
never take it back, and in the end it killed her. As soon
as her father told her that Sir Lancelot was going to the
tourney she besought him to wear her <a id="er_52" href="#ed_52">token</a> in the jousts,
but he was not willing. &ldquo;Fair damsel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I did
that, I should have done more for your sake than ever I did
for lady or damsel.&rdquo; But then he remembered that he was
to go disguised to the tourney, and because he had before
never worn any manner of token of any damsel, he bethought
him that, if he should take one of hers, none
would know him. So he said to her, &ldquo;Fair damsel, I will
wear your token on my helmet, if you will show me what
it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;it is a red sleeve, embroidered in
great pearls,&rdquo; and she brought it to him. &ldquo;Never have
I done so much for any damsel,&rdquo; said he, and gave his
own shield into her keeping, till he came again. Sir
Arthur had waited three days in Astolat for some Knights
who were long on the road, and when they had arrived
they all set forth, and were followed by Sir Lancelot and
Sir Lavaine, both with white shields, and Sir Lancelot bore
besides the red sleeve that was a token. Now Camelot was
filled with a great number of Kings and Lords and Knights,
but Sir Lavaine found means to lodge both himself and
Sir Lancelot secretly with a rich <a id="er_53" href="#ed_53">burgess</a>, and no man
knew who they were or whence they came. And there
they stayed till the day of the tourney. At earliest dawn
the trumpets blew, and King Arthur took his seat upon a
high scaffold, so that he might see who had done best; but
he would not suffer <a id="er_54" href="#ed_54">Sir Gawaine</a> to go from his side, for
Sir Gawaine never won the prize when Sir Lancelot was
in the field, and as King Arthur knew, Sir Lancelot oftentimes
disguised himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<div class="img" id="pica11">
<img src="images/illus_100.jpg" alt="ELAINE TIES HER SLEEVE ROVND SIR LANCELOT&rsquo;S HELMET" width="423" height="687" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Then the Knights formed into two parties and Sir
Lancelot made him ready, and Elaine fastened the red
sleeve upon his helmet. Then he and Sir Lavaine rode
into a little wood that lay behind the Knights who should
fight against those of the Round Table. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Sir
Lancelot, &ldquo;yonder is a company of good Knights and
they hold together as boars that are vexed with dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is truth,&rdquo; said Sir Lavaine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;if you will help me a little,
you shall see King Arthur&rsquo;s side, which is winning, driven
back as fast as they came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare not, Sir,&rdquo; answered Sir Lavaine, &ldquo;for I shall do
what I may.&rdquo; So they rode into the thickest of the <a id="er_55" href="#ed_55">press</a>,
and smote so hard both with spear and sword that the
Knights of the Round Table fell back. &ldquo;O mercy!&rdquo; cried
Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;what Knight is that yonder who does such
marvellous deeds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know well who it is,&rdquo; said King Arthur, &ldquo;but I will
not tell you yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;I should say it was Sir
Lancelot by the blows he deals and the manner that he
rides, but it cannot be he, for this man has a red sleeve
upon his helmet, and Sir Lancelot has never borne the
token of any lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him be,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur, &ldquo;you will find out his
name, and see him do greater deeds yet, before he departs.&rdquo;
And the Knights that were fighting against the King&rsquo;s
party took heart again, for before they feared they would
be beaten. But when Sir Bors saw this, he called unto
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
him the Knights that were of kin to Sir Lancelot, and
they banded together to make a great charge, and threw
Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s horse to the ground, and by misfortune the
spear of Sir Bors broke, and its head was left in Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s
side. When Sir Lavaine saw that, he unhorsed the
King of Scots, and brought his horse to Sir Lancelot, and
helped him to mount thereon and gave him a spear, with
which Sir Lancelot smote Sir Bors to the earth and Sir
Ector de Maris, the foster-father of King Arthur, and
buffeted sorely the Knights that were with them. Afterward
he hurled himself into the thick <i><a id="er_56" href="#ed_56">m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</a></i> of them all,
and did the most wonderful deeds that ever were heard of.
And Sir Lavaine likewise did well that day, for he smote
down full two Knights of the Round Table. &ldquo;Mercy,&rdquo;
again cried Sir Gawaine to Arthur, &ldquo;I marvel what Knight
that is with the red sleeve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you shall know soon,&rdquo; said King Arthur, and
commanded that the trumpets should be blown, and
declared that the prize belonged to the Knight with the
white shield, who bare the red sleeve, for he had unhorsed
more than thirty Knights. And the Kings and Lords who
were of his party came round him and thanked him for
the help he had given them, by which means the honours
of the day had been theirs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair Lords,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;if I have deserved
thanks, I have paid for them sorely, for I shall hardly
escape with my life, therefore I pray you let me depart,
for my hurt is grievous.&rdquo; Then he groaned piteously, and
galloped from them to a wood&rsquo;s side, followed by Sir
Lavaine. &ldquo;Oh help me, Sir Lavaine,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to get
this spear&rsquo;s head out of my side, for it is killing me.&rdquo;
But Sir Lavaine feared to touch it, lest Sir Lancelot should
bleed to death. &ldquo;I charge you,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;if you
love me, draw out the head,&rdquo; so Sir Lavaine drew it out.
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
And Sir Lancelot gave a great shriek, and a marvellous
grisly groan, and his blood flowed out so fast that he fell
into a swoon. &ldquo;Oh what shall I do?&rdquo; cried Sir Lavaine,
and he loosed Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s helm and coat of mail, and
turned him so that the wind might blow on him, but for
full half an hour he lay as if he had been dead. And at
last Sir Lancelot opened his eyes, and said, &ldquo;O Lavaine,
help me on my horse, for two miles from this place there
lives a hermit who once was a Knight of the Round Table,
and he can heal my wounds.&rdquo; Then Sir Lavaine, with
much ado, helped him on his horse, and brought him
bleeding to the hermit. The hermit looked at him as he
rode up, leaning piteously on his saddle-bow, and he
thought that he should know him, but could not tell who
he was for the paleness of his face, till he saw by a wound
on his cheek that it was Sir Lancelot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot hide your name from me,&rdquo; said the hermit,
&ldquo;for you are the noblest Knight in the world, and
well I know you to be Sir Lancelot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you know me, Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;help me for God&rsquo;s
sake, and for death or life put me out of this pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear nothing,&rdquo; answered the hermit, &ldquo;your pain will
soon be gone,&rdquo; and he called his servants to take the
armour off the Knight, and laid him in bed. After that
he dressed the wound, and gave him good wine to drink,
and Sir Lancelot slept and awoke free of his pain. So we
will leave him to be healed of his wound, under the care
of the hermit, and go back to King Arthur.</p>
<p>Now, it was the custom in those days that after a
tourney was finished, a great feast should be held at which
both parties were assembled, so King Arthur sent to ask
the King of <a id="er_57" href="#ed_57">Northgalis</a>, where was the Knight with the
red sleeve, who had fought on his side. &ldquo;Bring him
before me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that he may have the prize he has
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
won, which is his right.&rdquo; Then answered the King with
the hundred Knights, &ldquo;We fear the Knight must have
been sore hurt, and that neither you nor we are ever like
to see him again, which is grievous to think of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said King Arthur, &ldquo;is he then so badly
wounded? What is his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said they all, &ldquo;we know not his name, nor
whence he came, nor whither he went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; answered King Arthur, &ldquo;these tidings are
the worst that I have heard these seven years, for I would
give all the lands I hold that no harm had befallen this
Knight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo; asked they all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether I know him or not,&rdquo; said King Arthur, &ldquo;I
shall not tell you, but may Heaven send me good news of
him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; answered they.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my head,&rdquo; said Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;if this good Knight
is really wounded unto death, it is a great evil for all this
land, for he is one of the noblest that ever I saw for
handling a sword or spear. And if he may be found, I
shall find him, for I am sure he is not far from this town;&rdquo;
so he took his Squire with him, and they rode all round
Camelot, six or seven miles on every side, but nothing
could they hear of him. And he returned heavily to the
Court of King Arthur.</p>
<p>Two days after the King and all his company set out
for London, and by the way, it happened to Sir Gawaine
to lodge with Sir Bernard at Astolat. And when he was
in his chamber, Sir Bernard and his daughter Elaine came
unto Sir Gawaine, to ask him tidings of the Court, and who
did best in the tourney at Winchester.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;there were two Knights
that bare white shields, but one of them had a red sleeve
upon his helm, and he was one of the best Knights that
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
ever I saw joust in the field, for I dare say he smote down
forty Knights of the Table Round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now blessed be God,&rdquo; said the Maid of Astolat,
&ldquo;that that Knight sped so well, for he is the man in the
world that I loved first, and he will also be the last that
ever I shall love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair Maid,&rdquo; asked Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;is that Knight your
love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly he is my love,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know his name?&rdquo; asked Sir Gawaine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, truly,&rdquo; answered the damsel, &ldquo;I know neither
his name, nor whence he cometh, but I love him for all
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you meet him first?&rdquo; asked Sir Gawaine.
At that she told him the whole story, and how her brother
went with Sir Lancelot to do him service, and lent him
the white shield of her brother Sir Tirre and left his
own shield with her. &ldquo;Why did he do that?&rdquo; asked Sir
Gawaine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this cause,&rdquo; said the damsel, &ldquo;his shield was too
well known among many noble Knights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, fair damsel,&rdquo; said Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;I beg of you to
let me have a sight of that shield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;it is in my chamber covered
with a case, and if you will come with me, you shall
see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said Sir Bernard, and sent his Squire for it.
And when Sir Gawaine took off the case and beheld the
shield, and saw the arms, he knew it to be Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Ah mercy,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;my heart is heavier than ever it
was before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Elaine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have great cause,&rdquo; answered Sir Gawaine. &ldquo;Is that
Knight who owns this shield your love?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, truly,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I would I were his love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, fair damsel,&rdquo; replied Gawaine, &ldquo;for
if you love him, you love the most honourable Knight in
the world. I have known him for four and twenty years,
and never did I or any other Knight see him wear a token
of either lady or damsel at a tournament. Therefore,
damsel, he has paid you great honour. But I fear that
I may never behold him again upon earth, and that is
grievous to think of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;how may this be? Is he
slain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not say that,&rdquo; replied Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;but he
is sorely wounded, and is more likely to be dead than
alive. And, maiden, by this shield I know that he is
Sir Lancelot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can this be?&rdquo; said the Maid of Astolat, &ldquo;and
what was his hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; answered Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;it was the man
that loved him best who hurt him so, and I am sure that
if that man knew that it was Sir Lancelot whom he had
wounded, he would think it was the darkest deed that
ever he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, dear father,&rdquo; said Elaine, &ldquo;give me leave to
ride and to seek him, for I shall go out of my mind unless
I find him and my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as you will,&rdquo; answered her father, &ldquo;for I am
grieved to hear of the hurt of that noble Knight.&rdquo; So the
damsel made ready.</p>
<p>On the morn Sir Gawaine came to King Arthur and
told him how he had found the shield in the keeping of
the Maid of Astolat. &ldquo;All that I knew beforehand,&rdquo; said
the King, &ldquo;and that was why I would not suffer you to
fight at the tourney, for I had espied him when he entered
his lodging the night before. But this is the first time
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
that ever I heard of his bearing the token of some lady,
and much I marvel at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my head,&rdquo; answered Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;the Fair Maiden
of Astolat loves him wondrous well. What it all means,
or what will be the end, I cannot say, but she has ridden
after him to seek him.&rdquo; So the King and his company
came to London, and every one in the Court knew that it
was Sir Lancelot who had jousted the best.</p>
<p>And when the tidings came to Sir Bors, his heart grew
heavy, and also the hearts of his kinsmen. But when
the Queen heard that Sir Lancelot bore the red sleeve of
the Fair Maid of Astolat, she was nearly mad with wrath,
and summoned Sir Bors before her in haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Sir Bors,&rdquo; she cried when he was come, &ldquo;have the
tidings reached you that Sir Lancelot has been a false
Knight to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; answered Sir Bors, &ldquo;I pray you say not so,
for I cannot hear such language of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, is he not false and a traitor when, after swearing
that for right or wrong he would be my Knight and
mine only, he bore the red sleeve upon his helm at the
great jousts at Camelot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Sir Bors, &ldquo;I grieve bitterly as to that
sleeve-bearing, but I think he did it that none of his kin
should know him. For no man before that had seen him
bear the token of any lady, be she what she may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fie on him!&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;I myself heard Sir
Gawaine tell my lord Arthur of the great love that is
between the Fair Maiden of Astolat and him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; answered Sir Bors, &ldquo;I cannot hinder Sir
Gawaine from saying what he pleases, but as for Sir
Lancelot, I am sure that he loves no one lady or maiden
better than another. And therefore I will hasten to seek
him wherever he be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Meanwhile fair Elaine came to Winchester to find Sir
Lancelot, who lay in peril of his life in the hermit&rsquo;s dwelling.
And when she was riding hither and thither, not
knowing where she should turn, she fell on her brother
Sir Lavaine, who was exercising his horse. &ldquo;How doth
my lord Sir Lancelot?&rdquo; asked she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you, sister, that my lord&rsquo;s name was Sir
Lancelot?&rdquo; answered Sir Lavaine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Gawaine, who came to my father&rsquo;s house to rest
after the tourney, knew him by his shield,&rdquo; said she, and
they rode on till they reached the hermitage, and Sir
Lavaine brought her to Sir Lancelot. And when she saw
him so pale, and in such a plight, she fell to the earth in
a swoon, but by-and-by she opened her eyes and said,
&ldquo;My lord Sir Lancelot, what has brought you to this?&rdquo;
and swooned again. When she came to herself and stood
up, Sir Lancelot prayed her to be of good cheer, for if she
had come to comfort him she was right welcome, and
that his wound would soon heal. &ldquo;But I marvel,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;how you know my name.&rdquo; Then the maiden told
him how Sir Gawaine had been at Astolat and had seen
his shield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; sighed Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;it grieves me that my
name is known, for trouble will come of it.&rdquo; For he
knew full well that Sir Gawaine would tell Queen
Guenevere, and that she would be wroth. And Elaine
stayed and tended him, and Sir Lancelot begged Sir
Lavaine to ride to Winchester and ask if Sir Bors was
there, and said that he should know him by token of a
wound which Sir Bors had on his forehead. &ldquo;For well I
am sure,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;that Sir Bors will seek me,
as he is the same good Knight that hurt me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore as Sir Lancelot commanded, Sir Lavaine
rode to Winchester and inquired if Sir Bors had been
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
seen there, so that when he entered the town Sir Lavaine
readily found him. Sir Bors was overjoyed to hear good
tidings of Sir Lancelot, and they rode back together to
the hermitage. At the sight of Sir Lancelot lying in his
bed, pale and thin, Sir Bors&rsquo; heart gave way, and he wept
long without speaking. &ldquo;Oh, my lord Sir Lancelot,&rdquo; he
said at last, &ldquo;God send you hasty recovery; great is my
shame for having wounded you thus, you who are the
noblest Knight in the world. I wonder that my arm
would lift itself against you, and I ask your mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair cousin,&rdquo; answered Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;such words
please me not at all, for it is the fault of my pride which
would overcome you all, that I lie here to-day. We will
not speak of it any more, for what is done cannot be
undone, but let us find a cure so that I may soon be
whole.&rdquo; Then Sir Bors leaned upon his bed, and told
him how the Queen was filled with anger against him,
because he wore the red sleeve at the jousts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorrowful at what you tell me,&rdquo; replied Sir
Lancelot, &ldquo;for all I did was to hinder my being known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I said to excuse you,&rdquo; answered Sir Bors,
&ldquo;though it was all in vain. But is this damsel that is so
busy about you the Fair Maid of Astolat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She it is, and she will not go from me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should she go from you?&rdquo; asked Sir Bors.
&ldquo;She is a passing fair damsel, and of gentle breeding, and
I would that you could love her, for it is easy to see by
her bearing that she loves you entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It grieves me to hear that,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot.</p>
<p>After this they talked of other things, till in a few
days Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s wounds were whole again. When
Sir Lancelot felt his strength return, Sir Bors made him
ready, and departed for the Court of King Arthur, and
told them how he had left Sir Lancelot. And there was
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
on All Hallows a great tournament, and Sir Bors won
the prize for the unhorsing of twenty Knights, and Sir
Gareth did great deeds also, but vanished suddenly from
the field, and no man knew where he had gone. After
the tourney was over, Sir Bors rode to the hermitage to
see Sir Lancelot, whom he found walking on his feet, and
on the next morning they bade farewell to the hermit,
taking with them Elaine le Blanc. They went first to
Astolat, where they were well lodged in the house of Sir
Bernard, but when the morrow came, and Sir Lancelot
would have departed from them, Elaine called to her father
and to her brothers Sir Tirre and Sir Lavaine, and thus
she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord Sir Lancelot, fair Knight, leave me not, I
pray you, but have mercy upon me, and suffer me not to
die of love of thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you wish me to do?&rdquo; asked Sir Lancelot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have you for my husband,&rdquo; answered she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair damsel, I thank you,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;but
truly I shall never have a wife. But in token and thanks
of all your good will towards me, gladly will I give a
thousand pounds yearly when you set your heart upon
some other Knight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of such gifts I will have none,&rdquo; answered Elaine,
&ldquo;and I would have you know, Sir Lancelot, that if you
refuse to wed me, my good days are done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair damsel,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;I cannot do the
thing that you ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words she fell down in a swoon, and her
maids bore her to her chamber, where she made bitter
sorrow. Sir Lancelot thought it would be well for him to
depart before she came to her senses again, and he asked
Sir Lavaine what he would do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I do?&rdquo; asked Sir Lavaine, &ldquo;but follow
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
you, if you will have me.&rdquo; Then Sir Bernard came and
said to Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;I see well that my daughter Elaine
will die for your sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot marry her,&rdquo; answered Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;and it
grieves me sorely, for she is a good maiden, fair and
gentle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Sir Lavaine, &ldquo;she is as pure and good
as Sir Lancelot has said, and she is like me, for since first
I saw him I can never leave him.&rdquo; And after that they
bade the old man farewell and came unto Winchester,
where the King and all the Knights of the Round Table
made great joy of him, save only Sir Agrawaine and Sir
Mordred. But the Queen was angry and would not speak
to him, though he tried by all means to make her. Now
when the Fair Maid of Astolat knew he was gone, she
would neither eat nor sleep, but cried after Sir Lancelot
all the day long. And when she had spent ten days in
this manner, she grew so weak that they thought her soul
must quit this world, and the priest came to her, and bade
her dwell no more on earthly things. She would not
listen to him, but cried ever after Sir Lancelot, and how
she had loved none other, no, nor ever would, and that
her love would be her death. Then she called her father
Sir Bernard, and her brother Sir Tirre, and begged
her brother to write her a letter as she should tell him,
and her father that he would have her watched till she
was dead. &ldquo;And while my body is warm,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;let
this letter be put in my right hand, and my hand bound
fast with the letter until I be cold, and let me be dressed
in my richest clothes and be lain on a fair bed, and driven
in a chariot to the Thames. There let me be put on a
barge, and a dumb man with me, to steer the barge, which
shall be covered over with black samite. Thus, father, I
beseech you, let it be done.&rdquo; And her father promised
her faithfully that so it should be done to her when she
was dead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<div class="img" id="pica12">
<img src="images/illus_112.jpg" alt="THE BLACK BARGET" width="698" height="369" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Next day she died, and her body was lain on
the bed, and placed in a chariot, and driven to the Thames,
where the man awaited her with the barge. When she
was put on board, he steered the barge to Westminster
and rowed a great while to and fro, before any espied it.
At last King Arthur and Queen Guenevere withdrew into
a window, to speak together, and espied the black barge,
and wondered greatly what it meant. The King summoned
Sir Kay, and bade him take <a id="er_58" href="#ed_58">Sir Brandiles</a> and Sir
Agrawaine, and find out who was lying there, and they
ran down to the river side, and came and told the King.
&ldquo;That fair corpse will I see,&rdquo; returned the King, and he
took the Queen&rsquo;s hand and led her thither. Then he
ordered the barge to be made fast, and he entered it, and
the Queen likewise, and certain Knights with them. And
there he saw a fair woman on a rich bed, and her clothing
was of cloth of gold, and she lay smiling. While they
looked, all being silent, the Queen spied a letter in her
right hand, and pointed it out to the King, who took it
saying, &ldquo;Now I am sure this letter will tell us what she
was, and why she came hither.&rdquo; So leaving the barge in
charge of a trusty man, they went into the King&rsquo;s chamber,
followed by many Knights, for the King would have the
letter read openly. He then broke the seal himself, and
bade a clerk read it, and this was what it said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most noble Knight Sir Lancelot, I was your lover,
whom men called the Fair Maid of Astolat: therefore unto
all ladies I make my moan; yet pray for my soul, and
bury me. This is my last request. Pray for my soul,
Sir Lancelot, as thou art peerless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was all the letter, and the King and Queen and
all the Knights wept when they heard it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Sir Lancelot be sent for,&rdquo; presently said the
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
King, and when Sir Lancelot came the letter was read to
him also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord Arthur,&rdquo; said he, after he had heard it all,
&ldquo;I am right grieved at the death of this damsel. God
knows I was not, of my own will, guilty of her death,
and that I will call on her brother, Sir Lavaine, to witness.
She was both fair and good, and much was I beholden to
her, but she loved me out of measure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have been a little gentle with her,&rdquo;
answered the Queen, &ldquo;and have found some way to save
her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;she would have nothing
but my love, and that I could not give her, though I
offered her a thousand pounds yearly if she should set her
heart on any other Knight. For, Madam, I love not to be
forced to love; love must arise of itself, and not by
command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is truth,&rdquo; replied the King, &ldquo;love is free in himself,
and never will be bounden; for where he is bounden
he looseth himself. But, Sir Lancelot, be it your care to
see that the damsel is buried as is fitting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<h2><br />PART IV.</h2>
<h2 id="c12"><br />LANCELOT AND GUENEVERE.</h2>
<p>Now we come to the sorrowful tale of Lancelot and
Guenevere, and of the death of King Arthur. Already it
has been told that King Arthur had wedded Guenevere,
the daughter of Leodegrance, King of Cornwall, a damsel
who seemed made of all the flowers, so fair was she, and
slender, and brilliant to look upon. And the Knights in
her father&rsquo;s Court bowed down before her, and smote their
hardest in the jousts where Guenevere was present, but
none dared ask her in marriage till Arthur came. Like
the rest he saw and loved her, but, unlike them, he was a
King, and might lift his eyes even unto Guenevere. The
maiden herself scarcely saw or spoke to him, but did her
father&rsquo;s bidding in all things, and when he desired her to
make everything ready to go clothed as beseemed a Princess
to King Arthur&rsquo;s Court, her heart beat with joy at the sight
of rich stuffs and shining jewels. Then one day there
rode up to the Castle a band of horsemen sent by the
King to bring her to his Court, and at the head of them
Sir Lancelot du Lake, friend of King Arthur, and winner
of all the jousts and tournaments where Knights meet to
gain honour. Day by day they rode together apart and he
told her tales of gallant deeds done for love of beautiful
ladies, and they passed under trees gay with the first
green of spring, and over hyacinths covering the earth
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
with sheets of blue, till at sunset they drew rein before
the silken <a id="er_59" href="#ed_59">pavilion</a>, with the banner of Uther Pendragon
floating on the top. And Guenevere&rsquo;s heart went out to
Lancelot before she knew. One evening she noted, far
across the plain, towers and buildings shining in the sun,
and an array of horsemen ride forth to meet her. One
stopped before her dazzled eyes, and leaping from his
horse bowed low. Arthur had come to welcome her, and
do her honour, and to lead her home. But looking up at
him, she thought him cold, and, timid and alone, her
thoughts turned again to Lancelot. After that the days
and years slipped by, and these two were ever nearest
the King, and in every time of danger the King cried
for Lancelot, and trusted his honour and the Queen&rsquo;s
to him. Sir Lancelot spoke truly when he told Elaine
that he had never worn the badge of lady or maiden, but
for all that every one looked on Sir Lancelot as the
Queen&rsquo;s Knight, who could do no worship to any other
woman. The King likewise held Sir Lancelot bound to
fight the Queen&rsquo;s battles, and if he was absent on adventures
of his own, messengers hastened to bring him back,
as in the fight with Sir Mador. So things went on for
many years, and the King never guessed that the Queen
loved Lancelot best.</p>
<p>It befell one spring, in the month of May, that Queen
Guenevere bethought herself that she would like to go
a-maying in the woods and fields that lay round the City
of Westminster on both sides of the river. To this intent
she called her own especial Knights, and bade them be
ready the next morning clothed all in green, whether of
silk or cloth, &ldquo;and,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I shall bring with me ten
ladies, and every Knight shall have a lady behind him,
and be followed by a Squire and two yeomen, and I will
that you shall all be well horsed.&rdquo; Thus it was done, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
the ten Knights, arrayed in fresh green, the emblem of the
spring, rode with the Queen and her ladies in the early
dawn, and smelt the sweet of the year, and gathered
flowers which they stuck in their girdles and <a id="er_60" href="#ed_60">doublets</a>.
The Queen was as happy and light of heart as the
youngest maiden, but she had promised to be with the
King at the hour of ten, and gave the signal for departure
unwillingly. The Knights were mounting their horses,
when suddenly out of a wood on the other side rode Sir
Meliagraunce, who for many years had loved the Queen,
and had sought an occasion to carry her off, but found
none so fair as this. Out of the forest he rode, with two
score men in armour, and a hundred archers behind him,
and bade the Queen and her followers stay where they
were, or they would fare badly. &ldquo;Traitor,&rdquo; cried the
Queen, &ldquo;what evil deed would you do? You are a
King&rsquo;s son and a Knight of the Round Table, yet you
seek to shame the man who gave you knighthood. But I
tell you that you may bring dishonour on yourself, but
you will bring none on me, for rather would I cut my
throat in twain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for your threats, Madam, I pay them no heed,&rdquo;
returned Sir Meliagraunce; &ldquo;I have loved you many a
year, and never could I get you at such an advantage as
I do now, and therefore I will take you as I find you.&rdquo;
Then all the Knights spoke together saying, &ldquo;Sir Meliagraunce,
bethink yourself that in attacking men who are
unarmed you put not only our lives in peril but your
own honour. Rather than allow the Queen to be shamed
we will each one fight to the death, and if we did aught
else we should dishonour our knighthood for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight as well as you can,&rdquo; answered Sir Meliagraunce,
&ldquo;and keep the Queen if you may.&rdquo; So the
Knights of the Round Table drew their swords, and the men
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
of Sir Meliagraunce ran at them with spears; but the
Knights stood fast, and clove the spears in two before they
touched them. Then both sides fought with swords, and
Sir Kay and five other Knights were felled to the ground
with wounds all over their bodies. The other four fought
long, and slew forty of the men and archers of Sir
Meliagraunce; but in the end they too were overcome.
When the Queen saw that she cried out for pity and
sorrow, &ldquo;Sir Meliagraunce, spare my noble Knights and
I will go with you quietly on this condition, that their
lives be saved, and that wherever you may carry me
they shall follow. For I give you warning that I would
rather slay myself than go with you without my Knights,
whose duty it is to guard me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied Sir Meliagraunce, &ldquo;for your sake
they shall be led with you into my own castle, if you will
consent to ride with me.&rdquo; So the Queen prayed the four
Knights to fight no more, and she and they would not part,
and to this, though their hearts were heavy, they agreed.</p>
<p>The fight being ended the wounded Knights were
placed on horseback, some sitting, some lying across the
saddle, according as they were hurt, and Sir Meliagraunce
forbade any one to leave the castle (which had been a
gift to him from King Arthur), for sore he dreaded the
vengeance of Sir Lancelot if this thing should reach his
ears. But the Queen knew well what was passing in his
mind, and she called a little page who served her in her
chamber and desired him to take her ring and hasten
with all speed to Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;and pray him, if he
loves me, to rescue me. Spare not your horse, neither
for water nor for land.&rdquo; And the boy bided his time,
then mounted his horse, and rode away as fast as he
might. Sir Meliagraunce spied him as he flew, and
knew whither he went, and who had sent him; and he
commanded his best archers to ride after him and shoot
him ere he reached Sir Lancelot. But the boy escaped
their arrows, and vanished from their sight. Then
Sir Meliagraunce said to the Queen, &ldquo;You seek to betray
me, Madam; but Sir Lancelot shall not so lightly come at
you.&rdquo; And he bade his men follow him to the castle in
haste, and left an ambush of thirty archers in the road,
charging them that if a Knight mounted on a white
horse came along that way they were to slay the horse
but to leave the man alone, as he was hard to overcome.
After Sir Meliagraunce had given these orders his company
galloped fast to the castle; but the Queen would
listen to nothing that he said, demanding always that
her Knights and ladies should be lodged with her, and
Sir Meliagraunce was forced to let her have her will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<div class="img" id="picb4">
<img src="images/illus_119.jpg" alt="GUENEVERE SENDS HER PAGE TO LANCELOT FOR HELP." width="414" height="591" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>The castle of Sir Meliagraunce was distant seven
miles from Westminster, so it did not take long for the
boy to find Sir Lancelot, and to give him the Queen&rsquo;s
ring and her message. &ldquo;I am ashamed for ever,&rdquo; said Sir
Lancelot, &ldquo;unless I can rescue that noble lady,&rdquo; and
while he put on his armour, he called to the boy to tell
him the whole adventure. When he was armed and
mounted, he begged the page to warn Sir Lavaine where
he had gone, and for what cause. &ldquo;And pray him, as he
loves me, that he follow me to the castle of Sir Meliagraunce,
for if I am a living man, he will find me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Lancelot put his horse into the water at Westminster,
and he swam straight over to Lambeth, and soon
after he landed he found traces of the fight. He rode
along the track till he came to the wood, where the
archers were lying waiting for him, and when they saw
him, they bade him on peril of his life to go no further
along that path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I, who am a Knight of the Round Table,
turn out of any path that pleases me?&rdquo; asked Sir
Lancelot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<div class="img" id="pica13">
<img src="images/illus_121.jpg" alt="THE ARCHERS THREATEN LANCELOT" width="418" height="670" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Either you will leave this path or your horse will be
slain,&rdquo; answered the archers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may slay my horse if you will,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot,
&ldquo;but when my horse is slain I shall fight you on foot,
and so would I do, if there were five hundred more of
you.&rdquo; With that they smote the horse with their arrows,
but Sir Lancelot jumped off, and ran into the wood, and
they could not catch him. He went on some way, but
the ground was rough, and his armour was heavy, and
sore he dreaded the treason of Sir Meliagraunce. His
heart was near to fail him, when there passed by a cart
with two carters that came to fetch wood. &ldquo;Tell me,
carter,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;what will you take to suffer me
to go in your cart till we are within two miles of the castle
of Sir Meliagraunce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot take you at all,&rdquo; answered the carter, &ldquo;for I
am come to fetch wood for my lord Sir Meliagraunce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is with him that I would speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not go with me,&rdquo; said the carter, but hardly
had he uttered the words when Sir Lancelot leapt up into
the cart, and gave him such a buffet that he fell dead on
the ground. At this sight the other carter cried that he
would take the Knight where he would if he would only
spare his life. &ldquo;Then I charge you,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot,
&ldquo;that you bring me to the castle gate.&rdquo; So the carter
drove at a great gallop, and Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s horse, who had
espied his master, followed the cart, though more than fifty
arrows were standing in his body. In an hour and a half
they reached the castle gate, and were seen of Guenevere
and her ladies, who were standing in a window. &ldquo;Look,
Madam,&rdquo; cried one of her ladies, &ldquo;in that cart yonder is a
goodly armed Knight. I suppose he is going to his
hanging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked the Queen, and as she spoke she
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
espied that it was Sir Lancelot, and that his horse was
following riderless. &ldquo;Well is he that has a trusty friend,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;for a noble Knight is hard pressed when he
rides in a cart,&rdquo; and she rebuked the lady who had declared
he was going to his hanging. &ldquo;It was foul talking, to
liken the noblest Knight in the world to one going to a
shameful death.&rdquo; By this Sir Lancelot had come to the
gate of the castle, and he got down and called till the castle
rang with his voice. &ldquo;Where is that false traitor Sir
Meliagraunce, Knight of the Round Table? Come forth,
you and your company, for I, Sir Lancelot du Lake, am
here to do battle with you.&rdquo; Then he burst the gate open
wide, and smote the porter who tried to hold it against him.
When Sir Meliagraunce heard Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s voice, he ran
into Queen Guenevere&rsquo;s chamber and fell on his knees
before her: &ldquo;Mercy, Madam, mercy! I throw myself
upon your grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you now?&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;of a truth I might
well expect some good Knight to avenge me, though my
lord Arthur knew not of your work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame, I will make such amends as you yourself
may desire,&rdquo; pleaded Sir Meliagraunce, &ldquo;and I trust
wholly to your grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you have me do?&rdquo; asked the Queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rule in this castle as if it were your own, and give
Sir Lancelot cheer till to-morrow, and then you shall all
return to Westminster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say well,&rdquo; answered the Queen. &ldquo;Peace is ever
better than war, and I take no pleasure in fighting.&rdquo; So
she went down with her ladies to Sir Lancelot, who still
stood full of rage in the inner court, calling as before
&ldquo;Traitor Knight, come forth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Lancelot,&rdquo; asked the Queen, &ldquo;what is the cause
of all this wrath?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;does such a question
come from you? Methinks your wrath should be greater
than mine, for all the hurt and the dishonour have fallen
upon you. My own hurt is but little, but the shame is
worse than any hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say truly,&rdquo; replied the Queen, &ldquo;but you must
come in with me peaceably, as all is put into my hand,
and the Knight repents bitterly of his adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;since you have made
agreement with him, it is not my part to say nay, although
Sir Meliagraunce has borne himself both shamefully and
cowardly towards me. But had I known you would have
pardoned him so soon, I should not have made such haste
to come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; asked the Queen; &ldquo;do you
repent yourself of your good deeds? I only made peace
with him to have done with all this noise of slanderous
talk, and for the sake of my Knights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; answered Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;you understand
full well that I was never glad of slander nor noise, but
there is neither King, Queen, nor Knight alive, save yourself,
Madam, and my lord Arthur, that should hinder me
from giving Sir Meliagraunce a cold heart before I
departed hence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I know well,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;but what would
you have more? Everything shall be ordered as you
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;as long as you are
pleased, that is all I care for,&rdquo; so the Queen led Sir Lancelot
into her chamber, and commanded him to take off his
armour, and then took him to where her ten Knights were
lying sore wounded. And their souls leapt with joy when
they saw him, and he told them how falsely Sir Meliagraunce
had dealt with him, and had set archers to slay
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
his horse, so that he was fain to place himself in a cart.
Thus they complained each to the other, and would have
avenged themselves on Sir Meliagraunce but for the peace
made by the Queen. And in the evening came Sir
Lavaine, riding in great haste, and Sir Lancelot was glad
that he was come.</p>
<p>Now, Sir Lancelot was right when he feared to trust
Sir Meliagraunce, for that Knight only sought to work ill
both to him and to the Queen, for all his fair words. And
first he began to speak evil of the Queen to Sir Lancelot,
who dared him to prove his foul words, and it was settled
between them that a combat should take place in eight
days in the field near Westminster. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Sir
Meliagraunce, &ldquo;since it is decided that we must fight
together, I beseech you, as you are a noble Knight, do me
no treason nor villainy in the mean time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any Knight will bear me witness,&rdquo; answered Sir
Lancelot, &ldquo;that never have I broken faith with any man,
nor borne fellowship with those that have done so.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then let us go to dinner,&rdquo; said Sir Meliagraunce, &ldquo;and
afterwards you may all ride to Westminster. Meanwhile
would it please you to see the inside of this castle?&rdquo;
&ldquo;That I will gladly,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, and they went
from chamber to chamber, till they reached the floor of the
castle, and as he went Sir Lancelot trod on a trap and the
board rolled, and he fell down in a cave which was filled
with straw, and Sir Meliagraunce departed and no man
knew where Sir Lancelot might be. The Queen bethought
herself that he was wont to disappear suddenly, and as
Sir Meliagraunce had first removed Sir Lavaine&rsquo;s horse
from the place where it had been tethered, the Knights
agreed with her. So time passed until dinner had been
eaten, and then Sir Lavaine demanded litters for the
wounded Knights, that they might be carried to Westminster
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
with as little hurt as might be. And the Queen and her
ladies followed. When they arrived the Knights told of
their adventure, and how Sir Meliagraunce had accused
the Queen of treason, and how he and Sir Lancelot were
to fight for her good name in eight days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Meliagraunce has taken a great deal upon him,&rdquo;
said the King, &ldquo;but where is Sir Lancelot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered they all, &ldquo;we know not, but we think
he has ridden to some adventure.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, leave him
alone,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;He will be here when the day
comes, unless some treason has befallen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this while Sir Lancelot was lying in great pain
within the cave, and he would have died for lack of food
had not one of the ladies in the castle found out the place
where he was held captive, and brought him meat and
drink, and hoped that he might be brought to love her.
But he would not. &ldquo;Sir Lancelot,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you are
not wise, for without my help you will never get out of
this prison, and if you do not appear on the day of battle,
your lady, Queen Guenevere, will be burnt in default.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If I am not there,&rdquo; replied Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;the King and
the Queen and all men of worship will know that I am
either dead or in prison. And sure I am that there is
some good Knight who loves me or is of my kin, that will
take my quarrel in hand, therefore you cannot frighten me
by such words as these. If there was not another woman
in the world, I could give you no different answer.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then you will be shamed openly,&rdquo; replied the lady, and
left the dungeon. But on the day that the battle was to be
fought she came again, and said, &ldquo;Sir Lancelot, if you will
only kiss me once, I will deliver you, and give you the
best horse in Sir Meliagraunce&rsquo;s stable.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I will
kiss you,&rdquo; answered Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;since I may do that
honourably; but if I thought it were any shame to kiss
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
you, I would not do it, whatever the cost.&rdquo; So he kissed
her, and she brought him his armour, and led him to a
stable where twelve noble horses stood, and bade him
choose the best. He chose a white courser, and bade the
keepers put on the best saddle they had, and with his
spear in his hand and his sword by his side, he rode away,
thanking the lady for all she had done for him, which
some day he would try to repay.</p>
<p>As the hours passed on and Sir Lancelot did not come,
Sir Meliagraunce called ever on King Arthur to burn the
Queen, or else bring forth Sir Lancelot, for he deemed full
well that he had Sir Lancelot safe in his dungeon. The King
and Queen were sore distressed that Sir Lancelot was missing,
and knew not where to look for him, and what to do.
Then stepped forth Sir Lavaine and said, &ldquo;My lord Arthur,
you know well that some ill-fortune has happened to Sir
Lancelot, and if he is not dead, he is either sick or in
prison. Therefore I beseech you, let me do battle instead
of my lord and master for my lady the Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you heartily, gentle Knight,&rdquo; answered Arthur,
&ldquo;for I am sure that Sir Meliagraunce accuses the Queen
falsely, and there is not one of the ten Knights who would
not fight for her were it not for his wounds. So do your
best, for it is plain that some evil has been wrought on Sir
Lancelot.&rdquo; Sir Lavaine was filled with joy when the King
gave him leave to do battle with Sir Meliagraunce, and
rode swiftly to his place at the end of the lists. And just
as the heralds were about to cry &ldquo;<a id="er_61" href="#ed_61">Lesses les aller</a>!&rdquo; Sir
Lancelot dashed into the middle on his white horse.
&ldquo;Hold and abide!&rdquo; commanded the King, and Sir
Lancelot rode up before him, and told before them all how
Sir Meliagraunce had treated him. When the King and
Queen and all the Lords heard Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s tale, their
hearts stirred within them with anger, and the Queen took
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
her seat by the King, in great trust of her champion. Sir
Lancelot and Sir Meliagraunce prepared themselves for
battle, and took their spears, and came together as thunder,
and Sir Lancelot bore Sir Meliagraunce right over his horse.
Then Sir Lancelot jumped down, and they fought on foot,
till in the end Sir Meliagraunce was smitten to the ground
by a blow on his head from his enemy. &ldquo;Most noble
Knight, save my life,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;for I yield myself unto
you, and put myself into the King&rsquo;s hands and yours.&rdquo;
Sir Lancelot did not know what to answer, for he longed
above anything in the world to have revenge upon him;
so he looked at the Queen to see whether she would give
him any sign of what she would have done. The Queen
wagged her head in answer, and Sir Lancelot knew by
that token that she would have him dead, and he understood,
and bade Sir Meliagraunce get up, and continue the
fight. &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Sir Meliagraunce, &ldquo;I will never rise
till you accept my surrender.&rdquo; &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; answered Sir
Lancelot. &ldquo;I will leave my head and left side bare, and
my left arm shall be bound behind me, and in this guise I
will fight with you.&rdquo; At this Sir Meliagraunce started to
his feet, and cried, &ldquo;My lord Arthur, take heed to this
offer, for I will take it, therefore let him be bound and
unarmed as he has said.&rdquo; So the Knights disarmed Sir
Lancelot, first his head and then his side, and his left hand
was bound behind his back, in such a manner that he
could not use his shield, and full many a Knight and lady
marvelled that Sir Lancelot would risk himself so. And
Sir Meliagraunce lifted his sword on high and would have
smitten Sir Lancelot on his bare head, had he not leapt
lightly to one side, and, before Sir Meliagraunce could
right himself, Sir Lancelot had struck him so hard upon
his helmet that his skull split in two, and there was
nothing left to do but to carry his dead body from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
field. And because the Knights of the Round Table
begged to have him honourably buried, the King agreed
thereto, and on his tomb mention was made of how he
came by his death, and who slew him. After this Sir
Lancelot was more cherished by the King and Queen than
ever he was before.</p>
<p>Among the many Knights at Arthur&rsquo;s Court who were
the sons of Kings were Sir Mordred and Sir Agrawaine,
who had three brothers, Sir Gawaine, Sir Gaheris and Sir
Gareth. And their mother was Queen of Orkney, sister
to King Arthur. Now Sir Agrawaine and Sir Mordred
had evil natures, and loved both to invent slanders and to
repeat them. And at this time they were full of envy of
the noble deeds Sir Lancelot had done, and how men called
him the bravest Knight of the Table Round, and said that
he was the friend of the King, and the sworn defender of
the Queen. So they cast about how they might ruin him,
and found the way by putting jealous thoughts into the
mind of Arthur.</p>
<p>As was told in the tale of the marriage of Arthur,
Queen Guenevere&rsquo;s heart had gone out to Lancelot on the
journey to the Court, and ever she loved to have him with
her. This was known well to Sir Mordred, who watched
eagerly for a chance to work her ill.</p>
<p>It came one day when Arthur proclaimed a hunt. Sir
Mordred guessed that Sir Lancelot, who did not love hunting,
would stay behind, and would spend the time holding
talk with the Queen. Therefore he went to the King and
began to speak evil of the Queen and Sir Lancelot. At
first King Arthur would listen to nothing, but slowly his
jealousy burned within him, and he let the ill words that
accused the Queen of loving Sir Lancelot the best, sink
into his mind, and told Sir Mordred and Sir Agrawaine
that they might do their worst, and he would not meddle
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
with them. But they let so many of their fellowship into
the secret of their foul plot, that at last it came to the ears
of Sir Bors, who begged Sir Lancelot not to go near the
Queen that day, or harm would come of it. But Sir
Lancelot answered that the Queen had sent for him, and
that she was his liege lady, and never would he hold back
when she summoned him to her presence. Therefore Sir
Bors went heavily away. By ill fortune, Sir Lancelot only
wore his sword under his great mantle, and scarcely had
he passed inside the door when Sir Agrawaine and Sir
Mordred, and twelve other Knights of the Table Round, all
armed and ready for battle, cried loudly upon Sir Lancelot,
that all the Court might hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;is there any armour
within your chamber that I might cover my body withal,
for if I was armed as they are I would soon crush them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; replied the Queen, &ldquo;I have neither sword nor
spear nor armour, and how can you resist them? You
will be slain and I shall be burnt. If you could only
escape their hands, I know you would deliver me from
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is grievous,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;that I who was
never conquered in all my life should be slain for lack of
armour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traitor Knight,&rdquo; cried Sir Mordred again, &ldquo;come out
and fight us, for you are so sore beset that you cannot
escape us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mercy,&rdquo; cried Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;I may not suffer
longer this shame and noise! For better were death at
once than to endure this pain.&rdquo; Then he took the Queen
in his arms and kissed her, and said, &ldquo;Most noble Christian
Queen, I beseech you, as you have ever been my special
good lady, and I at all times your true poor Knight, and
as I never failed you in right or in wrong, since the first
day that King Arthur made me Knight, that you will
pray for my soul, if I be here slain. For I am well
assured that Sir Bors, my nephew, and Sir Lavaine and
many more, will rescue you from the fire, and therefore,
mine own lady, comfort yourself whatever happens to me,
and go with Sir Bors, my nephew, and you shall live like
a Queen on my lands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<div class="img" id="picb5">
<img src="images/illus_131.jpg" alt="LANCELOT COMES OVT OF GVENEVERE&rsquo;S ROOM" width="412" height="539" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Lancelot,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;I will never live
after your days, but if you are slain I will take my death
as meekly as ever did any Christian Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Madam,&rdquo; answered Lancelot, &ldquo;since it is so, I
shall sell my life as dear as I may, and a thousandfold
I am more heavy for you than for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith Sir Lancelot wrapped his mantle thickly
round his arm, and stood beside the door, which the
Knights without were trying to break in by aid of a stout
wooden form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair Lords,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;leave this noise, and
I will open the door, and you may do with me what you
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open it then,&rdquo; answered they, &ldquo;for well you know
you cannot escape us, and we will save your life and
bring you before King Arthur.&rdquo; So Sir Lancelot opened
the door and held it with his left hand, so that but one
man could come in at once. Then came forward a strong
Knight, Sir Colegrevance of Gore, who struck fiercely at
Lancelot with his sword. But Sir Lancelot stepped on
one side, that the blow fell harmless, and with his arm
he gave Sir Colgrevance a buffet on the head so that he
fell dead. And Sir Lancelot drew him into the chamber,
and barred the door.</p>
<p>Hastily he unbuckled the dead Knight&rsquo;s armour, and
the Queen and her ladies put it on him, Sir Agrawaine
and Sir Mordred ever calling to him the while, &ldquo;Traitor
Knight, come out of that chamber!&rdquo; But Sir Lancelot
cried to them all to go away and he would appear next
morning before the King, and they should accuse him of
what they would, and he would answer them, and prove
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
his words in battle. &ldquo;Fie on you, traitor,&rdquo; said Sir
Agrawaine, &ldquo;we have you in our power, to save or to slay,
for King Arthur will listen to our words, and will believe
what we tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you like,&rdquo; answered Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;look to yourself,&rdquo;
and he flung open the chamber door, and strode in
amongst them and killed Sir Agrawaine with his first
blow, and in a few minutes the bodies of the other twelve
Knights lay on the ground beside his, for no man ever
withstood that buffet of Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s. He wounded Sir
Mordred also, so that he fled away with all his might.
When the clamour of the battle was still, Sir Lancelot
turned back to the Queen and said, &ldquo;Alas, Madam, they
will make King Arthur my foe, and yours also, but if you
will come with me to my castle, I will save you from all
dangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not go with you now,&rdquo; answered the Queen,
&ldquo;but if you see to-morrow that they will burn me to
death, then you may deliver me as you shall think best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I live I will deliver you,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot,
and he left her and went back to his lodging. When Sir
Bors, who was awaiting him, saw Sir Lancelot, he was
gladder than he ever had been in his whole life before.
&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; cried Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;why you are all armed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Sir Bors, &ldquo;after you had left us, I and
your friends and your kinsmen were so troubled that we
felt some great strife was at hand, and that perchance
some trap had been laid for you. So we put on armour
that we might help you whatever need you were in.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Fair nephew,&rdquo; said Lancelot, &ldquo;but now I have been
more hardly beset than ever I was in my life, and yet I
escaped,&rdquo; and he told them all that had happened. &ldquo;I
pray you, my fellows, that you will be of good courage
and stand by me in my need, for war is come to us all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Sir Bors, &ldquo;all is welcome that God
sends us, and we have had much good with you and much
fame, so now we will take the bad as we have taken the
good.&rdquo; And so said they all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you for your comfort in my great distress,&rdquo;
replied Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;and you, fair nephew, haste to the
Knights who are in this place, and find who is with me
and who is against me, for I would know my friends from
my foes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Sir Bors, &ldquo;before seven of the clock in the
morning you shall know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By seven o&rsquo;clock, as Sir Bors had promised, many
noble Knights stood before Sir Lancelot, and were sworn
to his cause. &ldquo;My lords,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you know well that
since I came into this country I have given faithful
service unto my lord King Arthur and unto my lady
Queen Guenevere. Last evening my lady, the Queen,
sent for me to speak to her, and certain Knights that
were lying in wait for me cried &lsquo;Treason,&rsquo; and much ado
I had to escape their blows. But I slew twelve of them,
and Sir Agrawaine, who is Sir Gawaine&rsquo;s brother; and
for this cause I am sure of mortal war, as these Knights
were ordered by King Arthur to betray me, and therefore
the Queen will be judged to the fire, and I may not suffer
that she should be burnt for my sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Sir Bors answered Sir Lancelot that it was truly
his part to rescue the Queen, as he had done so often
before, and that if she was burned the shame would be
his. Then they all took counsel together how the thing
might best be done, and Sir Bors deemed it wise to carry
her off to the Castle of Joyous Gard, and counselled that
she should be kept there, a prisoner, till the King&rsquo;s anger
was past and he would be willing to welcome her back
again. To this the other Knights agreed, and by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
advice of Sir Lancelot they hid themselves in a wood close
by the town till they saw what King Arthur would do.
Meanwhile Sir Mordred, who had managed to escape the
sword of Sir Lancelot, rode, wounded and bleeding, unto
King Arthur, and told the King all that had passed, and
how, of the fourteen Knights, he only was left alive. The
King grieved sore at his tale, which Sir Mordred had
made to sound as ill as was possible; for, in spite of all,
Arthur loved Sir Lancelot. &ldquo;It is a bitter blow,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that Sir Lancelot must be against me, and the fellowship
of the Table Round is broken for ever, as many a noble
Knight will go with him. And as I am the judge, the
Queen will have to die, as she is the cause of the death
of these thirteen Knights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord Arthur,&rdquo; said Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;be not over-hasty;
listen not to the foul tongue of Sir Mordred, who
laid this trap for Sir Lancelot, that we all know to be
the Queen&rsquo;s own Knight, who has done battle for her
when none else would. As for Sir Lancelot, he will prove
the right on the body of any Knight living that shall accuse
him of wrong&mdash;either him, or my lady Guenevere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I believe well,&rdquo; said King Arthur, &ldquo;for he trusts
so much in his own might that he fears no man; and
never more shall he fight for the Queen, for she must suffer
death by the law. Put on, therefore, your best armour,
and go with your brothers, Sir Gaheris and Sir Gareth,
and bring the Queen to the fire, there to have her judgment
and suffer her death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, my lord, that I will never do,&rdquo; cried Sir
Gawaine; &ldquo;my heart will never serve me to see her die,
and I will never stand by and see so noble a lady brought
to a shameful end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;let your brothers Sir Gaheris
and Sir Gareth be there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; replied Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;I know well how
loth they will be, but they are young and unable to say
you nay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Sir Gaheris and Sir Gareth spoke to King
Arthur: &ldquo;Sir, if you command us we will obey, but it
will be sore against our will. And if we go we shall be
dressed as men of peace, and wear no armour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make yourselves ready, then,&rdquo; answered the King,
&ldquo;for I would delay no longer in giving judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cried Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;that I should have lived
to see this day;&rdquo; and he turned and wept bitterly, and
went into his chamber.</p>
<p>So the Queen was led outside the gates, and her rich
dress was taken off, while her lords and ladies wrung
their hands in grief, and few men wore armour, for in that
day it was held that the presence of mail-clad Knights
made death more shameful. Now among those present
was one sent by Sir Lancelot, and when he saw the
Queen&rsquo;s dress unclasped, and the priest step forth to listen
to her confession, he rode to warn Sir Lancelot that the
hour had come. And suddenly there was heard a sound
as of rushing horses, and Sir Lancelot dashed up to the
fire, and all the Knights that stood around were slain, for
few men wore armour. Sir Lancelot looked not where he
struck, and Sir Gaheris and Sir Gareth were found in the
thickest of the throng. At last he reached the Queen, and,
throwing a mantle over her, he caught her on to his saddle
and rode away with her. Right thankful was the Queen
at being snatched from the fire, and her heart was grateful
to Sir Lancelot, who took her to his Castle of Joyous Gard,
and many noble Knights and Kings had fellowship with
them.</p>
<p>After King Arthur had given judgment for the Queen
to die, he went back into his Palace of Westminster, where
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
men came and told him how Sir Lancelot had delivered
her, and of the death of his Knights, and in especial of
Sir Gaheris and Sir Gareth, and he swooned away from
sorrow. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he cried, when he recovered from his
swoon, &ldquo;alas! that a crown was ever on my head, for in
these two days I have lost forty Knights and the fellowship
of Sir Lancelot and his kinsmen, and never more will
they be of my company. But I charge you that none tell
Sir Gawaine of the death of his brothers, for I am sure
that when he hears of Sir Gareth he will go out of his
mind. Oh, why did Sir Lancelot slay them? for Sir
Gareth loved Sir Lancelot more than any other man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; answered some of the Knights, &ldquo;but Sir
Lancelot saw not whom he smote, and therefore were they
slain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The death of those two,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;will cause the
greatest mortal war that ever was. I am sure that when
Sir Gawaine knows Sir Gareth is slain he will never suffer
me to rest till I have destroyed Sir Lancelot and all his
kin, or till they have destroyed me. My heart was never
so heavy as it is now, and far more grievous to me is the
loss of my good Knights, than of my Queen; for Queens
I might have in plenty, but no man had ever such a company
of Knights, and it hurts me sore that Sir Lancelot
and I should be at war. It is the ill will borne by
Sir Agrawaine and Sir Mordred to Sir Lancelot that has
caused all this sorrow.&rdquo; Then one came to Sir Gawaine
and told him that Sir Lancelot had borne off the Queen,
and that twenty-four Knights had been slain in the
combat. &ldquo;I knew well he would deliver her,&rdquo; said Sir
Gawaine, &ldquo;and in that, he has but acted as a Knight
should and as I would have done myself. But where
are my brethren? I marvel they have not been to
seek me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;Sir Gaheris and Sir Gareth
are slain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid any such thing,&rdquo; returned Sir Gawaine.
&ldquo;I would not for all the world that that had happened,
especially to my brother Sir Gareth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is slain,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;and it is grievous news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who slew him?&rdquo; asked Sir Gawaine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Lancelot slew them both,&rdquo; answered the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He cannot have slain Sir Gareth,&rdquo; replied Sir Gawaine,
&ldquo;for my brother Gareth loved him better than me and all
his brethren, and King Arthur too. And had Sir Lancelot
desired my brother to go with him, he would have turned
his back on us all. Therefore I can never believe that
Sir Lancelot slew my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, it is in every one&rsquo;s mouth,&rdquo; said the man. At
this Sir Gawaine fell back in a swoon and lay long as
if he were dead. Then he ran to the King, crying, &ldquo;O
King Arthur, mine uncle, my good brother Sir Gareth is
slain, and Sir Gaheris also,&rdquo; and the King wept with him.
At length Sir Gawaine said, &ldquo;Sir, I will go and see my
brother Sir Gareth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot do that,&rdquo; returned the King, &ldquo;for I have
caused him to be buried with Sir Gaheris, as I knew well
that the sight would cause you overmuch sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How came he, Sir Lancelot, to slay Sir Gareth?&rdquo;
asked Sir Gawaine; &ldquo;mine own good lord, I pray you
tell me, for neither Sir Gareth nor Sir Gaheris bore arms
against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is said,&rdquo; answered the King, &ldquo;that Sir Lancelot
slew them in the thickest of the press and knew them
not. Therefore let us think upon a plan to avenge their
deaths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My King, my lord and mine uncle,&rdquo; said Sir Gawaine,
&ldquo;I swear to you by my knighthood that from this day I
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
will never rest until Sir Lancelot or I be slain. And I
will go to the world&rsquo;s end till I find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not seek him so far,&rdquo; answered the King,
&ldquo;for I am told that Sir Lancelot will await me and you
in the Castle of Joyous Gard, and many people are flocking
to him. But call your friends together, and I will call
mine;&rdquo; and the King ordered letters to be sent throughout
all England summoning his Knights and vassals to the
siege of Joyous Gard. The Castle of Joyous Gard was
strong, and after fifteen weeks had passed no breach had
been made in its walls. And one day, at the time of harvest,
Sir Lancelot came forth on a truce, and the King and
Sir Gawaine challenged him to do battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; answered Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;with yourself I will
never strive, and I grieve sorely that I have slain your
Knights. But I was forced to it, for the saving of my life
and that of my lady the Queen. And except yourself, my
lord, and Sir Gawaine, there is no man that shall call me
traitor but he shall pay for it with his body. As to Queen
Guenevere, ofttimes, my lord, you have consented in the
heat of your passion that she should be burnt and destroyed,
and it fell to me to do battle for her, and her enemies
confessed their untruth, and acknowledged her innocent.
And at such times, my lord Arthur, you loved me and
thanked me when I saved your Queen from the fire, and
promised ever to be my good lord, for I have fought for
her many times in other quarrels than my own. Therefore,
my gracious lord, take your Queen back into your
grace again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To these words of Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s King Arthur answered
nothing, but in his heart he would fain have made peace
with Sir Lancelot, but Sir Gawaine would not let him.
He reproached Sir Lancelot bitterly for the deaths of his
brothers and kinsmen, and called Sir Lancelot a <a id="er_62" href="#ed_62">craven</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
and other ill names that he would not fight with King
Arthur. So at the last Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s patience and courtesy
failed him, and he told them that the next morning he
would give them battle.</p>
<p>The heart of Sir Gawaine leaped with joy when he
heard these words of Sir Lancelot, and he summoned all
his friends and his kinsfolk, and bade them watch well
Sir Lancelot, and to slay him if a chance offered. But
he knew not that Sir Lancelot had bidden the Knights
of his following in no wise to touch King Arthur or Sir
Gawaine. And when the dawn broke a great host marched
out of the Castle of Joyous Gard, with Sir Lancelot at the
head, and Sir Bors and <a id="er_63" href="#ed_63">Sir Lionel</a> commanding on either
side. All that day they fought, and sometimes one army
seemed to be gaining, and sometimes the other. Many
times King Arthur drew near Sir Lancelot, and would
have slain him, and Sir Lancelot suffered him, and would
not strike again. But the King was unhorsed by Sir
Bors, and would have been slain but for Sir Lancelot, who
stayed his hand. &ldquo;My lord Arthur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for God&rsquo;s
love, stop this strife. I cannot strike you, so you will gain
no fame by it, though your friends never cease from trying
to slay me. My lord, remember what I have done in
many places, and how evil is now my reward.&rdquo; Then
when King Arthur was on his horse again he looked on
Sir Lancelot, and tears burst from his eyes, thinking of
the great courtesy that was in Sir Lancelot more than in
any other man. He sighed to himself, saying softly,
&ldquo;Alas! that ever this war began,&rdquo; and rode away, while
the battle ended for that time and the dead were buried.</p>
<p>But Sir Gawaine would not suffer the King to make
peace, and they fought on, now in one place, and now in
another, till the Pope heard of the strife and sent a noble
clerk, the Bishop of Rochester, to charge the King to make
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
peace with Sir Lancelot, and to take back unto him his
Queen, the Lady Guenevere. Now, the King, as has been
said, would fain have followed the Pope&rsquo;s counsel and
have accorded with Sir Lancelot, but Sir Gawaine would
not suffer him. However, as to the Queen Sir Gawaine
said nothing; and King Arthur gave audience to the
Bishop, and swore on his great seal that he would take
back the Queen as the Pope desired, and that if Sir
Lancelot brought her he should come safe and go safe.
So the Bishop rode to Joyous Gard and showed Sir
Lancelot what the Pope had written and King Arthur
had answered, and told him of the perils which would
befall him if he withheld the Queen. &ldquo;It was never in
my thought,&rdquo; answered Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;to withhold the
Queen from King Arthur, but as she would have been
dead for my sake it was my part to save her life, and
to keep her from danger till better times came. And I
thank God that the Pope has made peace, and I shall be
a thousand times gladder to bring her back than I was to
take her away. Therefore ride to the King, and say that
in eight days I myself will bring the Lady Guenevere unto
him.&rdquo; So the Bishop departed, and came to the King at
Carlisle, and told him what Sir Lancelot had answered,
and tears burst from the King&rsquo;s eyes once more.</p>
<p>A goodly host of a hundred Knights rode eight days
later from the Castle of Joyous Gard; every Knight was
clothed in green velvet, and held in his hand a branch of
<a id="er_64" href="#ed_64">olive</a>, and bestrode a horse with trappings down to his
heels. And behind the Queen were four and twenty
gentlewomen clad in green likewise, while twelve esquires
attended on Sir Lancelot. He and the Queen wore
dresses of white and gold tissue, and their horses were
clothed in housings of the same, set with precious stones
and pearls; and no man had ever gazed on such a noble
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
pair, as they rode from Joyous Gard to Carlisle. When
they reached the castle, Sir Lancelot sprang from his
horse and helped the Queen from hers, and led her to
where King Arthur sat, with Sir Gawaine and many lords
around him. He kneeled down, and the Queen kneeled
with him, and many Knights wept as though it had been
their own kin. But Arthur sat still and said nothing.
At that Sir Lancelot rose, and the Queen likewise, and,
looking straight at the King, he spoke&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most noble King, I have brought to you my lady the
Queen, as right requires; and time hath been, my lord
Arthur, that you have been greatly pleased with me when
I did battle for my lady your Queen. And full well you
know that she has been put to great wrong ere this, and
it seems to me I had more cause to deliver her from this
fire, seeing she would have been burnt for my sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Sir Lancelot,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;I have
given you no cause to do to me as you have done, for I
have held you dearer than any of my Knights.&rdquo; But Sir
Gawaine would not suffer the King to listen to anything
Sir Lancelot said, and told him roughly that while one
of them lived peace could never be made, and desired
on behalf of the King that in fifteen days he should be
gone out of the country. And still King Arthur said
nothing, but suffered Sir Gawaine to talk as he would;
and Sir Lancelot took farewell of him and of the Queen,
and rode, grieving sorely, out of the Court, and sailed to
his lands beyond the sea.</p>
<p>Though the Queen was returned again, and Sir Lancelot
was beyond the sea, the hate of Sir Gawaine towards
him was in no way set at rest, but he raised a great host
and persuaded the King to follow him. And after many
sieges and long fighting it befell upon a day, that Sir
Gawaine came before the gates of Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s town,
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
armed at all points, and sitting on a noble horse, with a
great spear in his hand. And he cried with a great voice,
&ldquo;Where art thou now, thou false traitor, Sir Lancelot?
Why hidest within holes and walls like a coward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this language Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s kin and his Knights
drew round him, and they said, &ldquo;Now must you defend
yourself like a Knight or be shamed for ever. You have
slept already too long and suffered overmuch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Sir Lancelot bade them saddle his strongest horse
and fetch his arms, and he spoke aloud to King Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord Arthur and noble King, I am right sad for
your sake, for had I been vengeful then could I have met
you in the field. But for half a year I have forborne to
come near you, and now I can endure it no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Sir Gawaine said, &ldquo;Sir Lancelot, if thou darest
do battle, leave thy babbling and come forth, and let us
ease our hearts.&rdquo; Then Sir Lancelot and his noble Knights
came out of the city, and their number was so great that
Arthur marvelled, and sorrowed that he and Sir Lancelot
should be estranged. Then Sir Gawaine and Sir Lancelot
rode for each other, and at the word came together with a
great shock, and smote each other in the middle of their
shields. But the Knights were so strong, and their spears
so big, that the horses could not endure their buffets, and
fell to the earth. Then they fought together, and struck
each other on their sides so that the blood burst forth in
many places.</p>
<p>Now, Sir Gawaine, by a gift from a holy man, grew
thrice as strong in the three hours before noon than at
any other time, and this being the hour of the combat, Sir
Gawaine won great honour. For his sake the King had
all battles before him take place just before noon, and few
knew of this advantage save King Arthur.</p>
<p>Thus Sir Lancelot fought with Sir Gawaine, and felt
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
his might increase and wondered, dreading that he might
be shamed. And he thought that this must be a fiend and
no earthly man, so he covered himself with his shield, and
kept his might and breath until the three hours were past
and Sir Gawaine had no more than his own might. Then
Sir Lancelot doubled his strokes, and gave him a buffet on
the helmet, and Sir Gawaine fell down on his side. And
Sir Lancelot returned to his city, and Sir Gawaine was
carried to the King&rsquo;s pavilion. While he lay wounded,
news came from England that caused King Arthur to give
up his war with Sir Lancelot, and return in haste to his
own country.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><br />THE END OF IT ALL.</h2>
<p>Now, when King Arthur left England to fight with Sir
Lancelot, he ordered his nephew Sir Mordred to govern
the land, which that false Knight did gladly. And as
soon as he thought he might safely do so he caused some
letters to be written saying that King Arthur had been
slain in battle, and he had himself crowned King at
Canterbury, where he made a great feast which lasted
fifteen days. After it was over, he went to Winchester
and summoned Queen Guenevere, and told her that on a
certain day he would wed her and that she should make
herself ready. Queen Guenevere&rsquo;s soul grew cold and
heavy as she heard these words of Sir Mordred&rsquo;s, for she
hated him with all her might, as he hated her; but she
dared show nothing, and answered softly that she would do
his bidding, only she desired that first she might go to
London to buy all manner of things for her wedding.
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
Sir Mordred trusted her because of her fair speech, and
let her go. Then the Queen rode to London with all
speed, and went straight to the Tower, which she filled in
haste with food, and called her men-at-arms round her.
When Sir Mordred knew how she had beguiled him he
was wroth out of measure, and besieged the Tower, and
assaulted it many times with battering rams and great
engines, but could prevail nothing, for the Queen would
never, for fair speech nor for foul, give herself into his
hands again.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Canterbury hastened unto Sir Mordred,
and rebuked him for wishing to marry his uncle&rsquo;s wife.
&ldquo;Leave such desires,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;or else I shall
curse you with <a id="er_65" href="#ed_65">bell, book, and candle</a>. Also, you noise
abroad that my lord Arthur is slain, and that is not so,
and therefore you will make ill work in the land.&rdquo; At
this Sir Mordred <a id="er_66" href="#ed_66">waxed</a> very wroth, and would have
killed the Bishop had he not fled to Glastonbury, where
he became a hermit, and lived in poverty and prayed all
day long for the realm, for he knew that a fierce war was
at hand. Soon word came to Sir Mordred that King
Arthur was hurrying home across the seas, to be avenged
on his nephew, who had proved traitor. Wherefore Sir
Mordred sent letters to all the people throughout the
kingdom, and many followed after him, for he had cunningly
sown among them that with him was great joy and
softness of life, while King Arthur would bring war and
strife with him. So Sir Mordred drew with a great host
to Dover, and waited for the King. Before King Arthur
and his men could land from the boats and ships that had
brought them over the sea Sir Mordred set upon them,
and there was heavy slaughter. But in the end he and
his men were driven back, and he fled, and his people
with him. After the fight was over, the King ordered the
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
dead to be buried; and there came a man and told him
that he had found Sir Gawaine lying in a boat, and that
he was sore wounded. And the King went to him and
made moan over him: &ldquo;You were ever the man in the
world that I loved most,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you and Sir Lancelot.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mine uncle King Arthur,&rdquo; answered Sir Gawaine, &ldquo;my
death day has come, and all through my own fault. Had
Sir Lancelot been with you as he used to be this unhappy
war had never begun, and of that I am the cause, for I
would not accord with him. And therefore, I pray you,
give me paper, pen, and ink that I may write to him.&rdquo; So
paper and ink were brought, and Sir Gawaine was held up
by King Arthur, and a letter was writ wherein Sir
Gawaine confessed that he was dying of an old wound
given him by Sir Lancelot in the siege of one of the
cities across the sea, and thus was fulfilled the prophecy of
Merlin. &ldquo;Of a more noble man might I not be slain,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Also, Sir Lancelot, make no tarrying, but come
in haste to King Arthur, for sore bested is he with my
brother Sir Mordred, who has taken the crown, and would
have wedded my lady Queen Guenevere had she not
sought safety in the Tower of London. Pray for my soul,
I beseech you, and visit my tomb.&rdquo; And after writing
this letter, at the hour of noon, Sir Gawaine gave up his
spirit, and was buried by the King in the chapel within
Dover Castle. Then was it told King Arthur that Sir
Mordred had pitched a new field upon Barham Down,
and the next morning the King rode hither to him, and
there was a fierce battle between them, and many on both
sides were slain. But at the last King Arthur&rsquo;s party
stood best, and Sir Mordred and his men fled to Canterbury.</p>
<p>After the Knights which were dead had been buried,
and those that were wounded tended with healing <a id="er_67" href="#ed_67">salves</a>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
King Arthur drew westwards towards Salisbury, and
many of Sir Mordred&rsquo;s men followed after him, but they
that loved Sir Lancelot went unto Sir Mordred. And a
day was fixed between the King and Sir Mordred that
they should meet upon a down near Salisbury, and give
battle once more. But the night before the battle Sir
Gawaine appeared unto the King in a vision, and warned
him not to fight next day, which was Trinity Sunday, as
he would be slain and many of his Knights also; but to
make a truce for a month, and at the end of that time Sir
Lancelot would arrive, and would slay Sir Mordred, and
all his Knights with him. As soon as he awoke the King
called the Bishops and the wisest men of his army, and
told them of his vision, and took counsel what should be
done. And it was agreed that the King should send an
embassage of two Knights and two Bishops unto Sir
Mordred, and offer him as much goods and lands as they
thought best if he would engage to make a treaty for a
month with King Arthur.</p>
<p>So they departed, and came to Sir Mordred, where he
had a grim host of an hundred thousand men. For a long
time he would not suffer himself to be entreated, but at
the last he agreed to have Cornwall and Kent in King
Arthur&rsquo;s days, and after all England. Furthermore, it
was decided that King Arthur and Sir Mordred should
meet in the plain between their hosts, each with fourteen
persons. &ldquo;I am glad of this,&rdquo; said King Arthur, when he
heard what had been done; but he warned his men that
if they were to see a sword drawn they were to come on
swiftly and slay that traitor, Sir Mordred, &ldquo;for I in no
wise trust him.&rdquo; And in like wise spake Sir Mordred
unto his host. Then they two met, and agreed on the
truce, and wine was fetched and they drank, and all was
well. But while they were drinking an adder crept
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
out of a bush, and stung one of the fourteen Knights on
his foot, and he drew his sword to slay the adder, not
thinking of anything but his pain. And when the men
of both armies beheld that drawn sword, they blew
trumpets and horns and shouted grimly, and made them
ready for battle. So King Arthur leaped on his horse,
and Sir Mordred on his, and they went back to their own
armies, and thus began the fight, and never was there
seen one more doleful in any Christian land. For all day
long there was rushing and riding, spearing and striking,
and many a grim word was there spoken, and many a
deadly stroke given. And at the end full an hundred
thousand dead men lay upon the down, and King Arthur
had but two Knights left living, Sir Lucan and his brother
Sir Bedivere. &ldquo;Alas! that I should have lived to see this
day,&rdquo; cried the King, &ldquo;for now I am come to mine end;
but would to God that I knew where were that traitor
Sir Mordred that hath caused all this mischief.&rdquo; Then
suddenly he saw Sir Mordred leaning on his sword among
a great heap of dead men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me my spear,&rdquo; said King Arthur unto Sir
Lucan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, let him be,&rdquo; answered Sir Lucan. &ldquo;Remember
your dream, and leave off by this. For, blessed be God,
you have won the field, and we three be alive, and of the
others none is alive save Sir Mordred himself. If you leave
off now, the day of destiny is past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a id="er_68" href="#ed_68">Tide me death</a>, tide me life,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;he shall
not escape my hands, for a better chance I shall never have;&rdquo;
and he took his spear in both hands and ran towards Sir
Mordred, crying, &ldquo;Traitor! now is your death day come,&rdquo;
and smote him under the shield, so that the spear went
through his body. And when Sir Mordred felt he had his
death wound, he raised himself up and struck King Arthur
such a blow that the sword clave his helmet, and then fell
<a id="er_69" href="#ed_69">stark</a> dead on the earth again. When Sir Lucan and Sir
Bedivere saw that sight they carried the King to a little
chapel, but they hoped not to leave him there long, for Sir
Lucan had noted that many people were stealing out to rob
the slain of the ornaments on their armour. And those
that were not dead already they slew.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;Would that I could quit this place to go to some large
town,&rdquo; said the King, when he had heard this, &ldquo;but I
cannot stand, my head works so. Ah, Lancelot, sorely
have I missed thee.&rdquo; At that Sir Lucan and Sir Bedivere
tried to lift him, but Sir Lucan had been grievously
wounded in the fight, and the blood burst forth again as
he lifted Arthur, and he died and fell at the feet of the
King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;he has died for my sake, and
he had more need of help than I. But he would not complain,
his heart was so set to help me. And I should
sorrow yet more if I were still to live long, but my time
flieth fast. Therefore, Sir Bedivere, cease moaning and
weeping, and take Excalibur, my good sword, and go with
it to yonder water-side, and when thou comest there, I
charge thee, throw my sword in that water, and come again
and tell me what thou hast seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; answered Sir Bedivere, &ldquo;your commandment
shall be done,&rdquo; and he departed. But when he
looked at that noble sword, and beheld the jewels and gold
that covered the pommel and hilt, he said to himself, &ldquo;If
I throw this rich sword into the water no good will come
of it, but only harm and loss;&rdquo; so he hid Excalibur under a
tree, and returned unto the King and told him his bidding
was done. &ldquo;What did you see there?&rdquo; asked the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Sir Bedivere. &ldquo;I saw nothing but the
winds and the waves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have not dealt truly with me,&rdquo; said the King.
&ldquo;Go back, and do my command; spare not, but throw it
in.&rdquo; But again Sir Bedivere&rsquo;s heart failed him, and he
hid the sword, and returned to tell the King he had seen
nothing but the <a id="er_70" href="#ed_70">wan</a> water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, traitor!&rdquo; cried King Arthur, &ldquo;this is twice you
have betrayed me. If you do not now fulfil my bidding,
with mine own hands will I slay you, for you would gladly
see me dead for the sake of my sword.&rdquo; Then Sir Bedivere
was shamed at having disobeyed the King, and drew
forth the sword from its hiding-place, and carried it to the
water-side, and with a mighty swing threw it far into
the water. And as it flew through the air, an arm and
hand lifted itself out of the water, and caught the hilt,
and brandished the sword thrice, and vanished with it
beneath the water. So Sir Bedivere came again unto the
King, and told him what he saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;help me hence, for I have
tarried overlong;&rdquo; and Sir Bedivere took him on his back,
and bare him to the water-side. And when they stood by
the bank, a little barge containing many fair ladies and a
Queen, all in black hoods, drew near, and they wept and
shrieked when they beheld King Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now put me into the barge,&rdquo; said the King, and Sir
Bedivere laid him softly down, and the ladies made great
mourning, and the barge rowed from the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my lord Arthur!&rdquo; cried Sir Bedivere, &ldquo;what
shall become of me now you go from me, and I am left
here alone with my enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Comfort yourself,&rdquo; replied the King, &ldquo;and do as well
as you may, for I go unto the valley of Avilion, to be
healed of my grievous wound. And if you never more
hear of me, pray for my soul.&rdquo; But Sir Bedivere watched
the barge till it was beyond his sight, then he rode all
night till he came to a hermitage. Now when Queen
Guenevere heard of the battle, and how that King Arthur
was slain and Sir Mordred and all their Knights, she stole
away, and five ladies with her, and rode to Amesbury;
and there she put on clothes of black and white, and
became a nun, and did great penance, and many <a id="er_71" href="#ed_71">alms deeds</a>,
and people marvelled at her and at her godly life.
And ever she wept and moaned over the years that were
past, and for King Arthur.</p>
<p>As soon as the messenger whom the King had sent
with Sir Gawaine&rsquo;s letter reached Sir Lancelot, and he
learned that Sir Mordred had taken for himself the crown
of England, he rose up in wrath, and, calling Sir Bors, bid
him collect their host, that they should pass at once over
the sea to avenge themselves on that false Knight. A fair
wind blew them to Dover, and there Sir Lancelot asked
tidings of King Arthur. Then the people told him that
the King was slain, and Sir Mordred, and an hundred
thousand men besides, and that the King had buried Sir
Gawaine in the chapel at Dover Castle. &ldquo;Fair Sirs,&rdquo; said
Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;show me that tomb;&rdquo; and they showed it
to him, and Sir Lancelot kneeled before it, and wept and
prayed, and this he did for two days. And on the third
morning he summoned before him all the great lords and
leaders of his host, and said to them, &ldquo;Fair lords, I thank
you all for coming here with me, but we come too late,
and that will be bitter grief to me as long as I shall live.
But since it is so, I will myself ride and seek my lady
Guenevere in the west country, where they say she has
gone, and tarry you here, I entreat you, for fifteen days,
and if I should not return take your ships and depart into
your own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bors strove to reason with him that the quest
was fruitless, and that in the west country he would
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
find few friends; but his words availed nothing. For
seven days Sir Lancelot rode, and at last he came to a
nunnery, where Queen Guenevere was looking out from
her lattice, and was ware of his presence as he walked in
the cloister. And when she saw him she swooned, and
her ladies and gentlewomen tended her. When she was
recovered, she spoke to them and said, &ldquo;You will marvel,
fair ladies, why I should swoon. It was caused by the
sight of yonder Knight who stands there, and I pray you
bring him to me.&rdquo; As soon as Sir Lancelot was brought,
she said to her ladies, &ldquo;Through me and this man has this
war been wrought, for which I repent me night and day.
Therefore, Sir Lancelot, I require and pray you never to
see my face again, but go back to your own land, and
govern it and protect it; and take to yourself a wife, and
pray that my soul may be made clean of its ill doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Madam,&rdquo; answered Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;that shall I
never do; but the same life that you have taken upon you,
will I take upon me likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will do so,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;it is well; but
I may never believe but that you will turn to the world
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Madam,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;you speak as it pleases
you, but you never knew me false to my promise, and I
will forsake the world as you have done. For if in the
quest of the Sangreal I had forsaken its vanities with all
my heart and will, I had passed all Knights in the quest,
except Sir Galahad my son. And therefore, lady, since
you have taken you to perfection, I must do so also, and if
I may find a hermit that will receive me I will pray and do
penance while my life lasts. Wherefore, Madam, I beseech
you to kiss me once again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;that I may not do,&rdquo; and Sir
Lancelot took his horse and departed in great sorrow. All
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
that day and the next night he rode through the forest till
he beheld a hermitage and a chapel between two cliffs, and
heard a little bell ring to Mass. And he that sang Mass
was the Bishop of Canterbury, and Sir Bedivere was with
him. After Mass Sir Bedivere told Sir Lancelot how King
Arthur had thrown away his sword and had sailed to the
valley of Avilion, and Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s heart almost burst for
grief. Then he kneeled down and besought the Bishop
that he might be his brother. &ldquo;That I will gladly,&rdquo; said
the Bishop, and put a robe upon him.</p>
<p>After the fifteen days were ended, and still Sir Lancelot
did not return, Sir Bors made the great host go back across
the sea, while he and some of Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s kin set forth
to seek all over England till they found Sir Lancelot. They
rode different ways, and by fortune Sir Bors came one day
to the chapel where Sir Lancelot was. And he prayed
that he might stay and be one of their fellowship, and in
six months six other Knights were joined to them, and
their horses went where they would, for the Knights spent
their lives in fasting and prayer, and kept no riches for
themselves.</p>
<p>In this wise six years passed, and one night a vision
came to Sir Lancelot in his sleep charging him to hasten
unto Amesbury. &ldquo;By the time that thou come there,&rdquo;
said the vision, &ldquo;thou shalt find Queen Guenevere dead;
therefore take thy fellows with thee and fetch her corpse,
and bury it by the side of her husband, the noble King
Arthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Sir Lancelot rose up and told the hermit, and
the hermit ordered him to make ready and to do all as
the vision had commanded. And Sir Lancelot and seven
of the other Knights went on foot from Glastonbury to
Amesbury, and it took them two days to compass the
distance, for it was far and they were weak with fasting.
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
When they reached the nunnery Queen Guenevere had
been dead but half an hour, and she had first summoned
her ladies to her, and told them that Sir Lancelot had
been a priest for near a twelvemonth. &ldquo;And hither he
cometh as fast as he may,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to fetch my corpse,
and beside my lord King Arthur he shall bury me. And
I beseech Almighty God that I may never have power to
see Sir Lancelot with my bodily eyes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; said the
ladies, &ldquo;she prayed for two days till she was dead.&rdquo; Then
Sir Lancelot looked upon her face and sighed, but wept
little, and next day he sang Mass. After that the Queen
was laid on a bier drawn by horses, and an hundred torches
were carried round her, and Sir Lancelot and his fellows
walked behind her singing holy chants, and at times one
would come forward and throw incense on the dead. So
they came to Glastonbury, and the Bishop of Canterbury
sang a Requiem Mass over the Queen, and she was wrapped
in cloth, and placed first in a web of lead, and then in a
coffin of marble, and when she was put into the earth Sir
Lancelot swooned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to blame,&rdquo; said the hermit, when he awaked
from his swoon, &ldquo;you ought not make such manner of
sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; answered Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;I trust I do not
displease God, but when I remember her beauty, and
her nobleness, and that of the King, and when I saw his
corpse and her corpse lie together, my heart would not
bear up my body. And I remembered, too, that it was
through me and my pride that they both came to their
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that day Sir Lancelot ate so little food that he
<a id="er_72" href="#ed_72">dwined</a> away, and for the most part was found kneeling
by the tomb of King Arthur and Queen Guenevere.
None could comfort him, and after six weeks he was too
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
weak to rise from his bed. Then he sent for the hermit
and to his fellows, and asked in a weary voice that they
would give him the last rites of the Church; and begged
that when he was dead his body might be taken to Joyous
Gard, which some say is Alnwick and others Bamborough.
That night the hermit had a vision that he saw Sir Lancelot
being carried up to heaven by the angels, and he waked
Sir Bors and bade him go and see if anything ailed Sir
Lancelot. So Sir Bors went and Sir Lancelot lay on his
bed, stark dead, and he smiled as he lay there. Then was
there great weeping and wringing of hands, more than had
been made for any man; but they placed him on the horse
bier that had carried Queen Guenevere, and lit a hundred
torches, and in fifteen days they reached Joyous Gard.
There his body was laid in the choir, with his face uncovered,
and many prayers were said over him. And
there, in the midst of their praying, came Sir Ector de
Maris, who for seven years had sought Sir Lancelot
through all the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Lancelot,&rdquo; he said, when he stood looking beside
his dead body, &ldquo;thou wert head of all Christian Knights.
Thou wert the courtliest Knight that ever drew sword, and
the faithfulest friend that ever bestrode a horse. Thou
wert the goodliest Knight that ever man has seen, and the
truest lover that ever loved a woman.&rdquo;</p>

Duke of Tintagil. In the siege that followed the Duke of Tintagil was
killed, and his lady, the dame Igraine, afterwards became the wife of
King Uthur. It is also explained how, on the advice of Merlin, their
son Arthur was fostered by the wife of a certain Sir Ector, and brought
up with his son Kay. Uther Pendragon died two years after this, and
on his deathbed Merlin asked if Arthur should not be proclaimed his
successor. To this Uther Pendragon replied, &ldquo;I give him my blessing,
and righteously may he claim the crown on forfeiture of my blessing.&rdquo;
Merlin had to provide some other means therefore to enable Arthur to
succeed to his heritage, and this we have in the tale of the &ldquo;Drawing
